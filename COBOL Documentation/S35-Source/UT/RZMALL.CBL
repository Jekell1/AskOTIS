      *  DESCRIPTION: END OF MONTH DRIVER FOR MULTIPLE DATA SETS
      *
      *  THIS UPDATE IS DRIVEN OFF THE RC-FILE, SO IT IS CONTROLLED
      *  BY & UPDATES RC-STATUS.  BEFORE THE UPDATE CAN BEGIN, THE
      *  PROGRAM CL/CKSTAT IS CALLED TO VERIFY THAT ALL BRANCHES IN
      *  THE SELECTED BRANCH RANGE OR GROUP ARE AT THE CORRECT STATUS.
      *
      *  IF CUSTOMER IS NOT CASH METHOD AND/OR DOES IB ACCRUALS,
      *  MOST OF THE STATUS CHECKING HAS BEEN HANDLED IN THE EOM
      *  ACCRUAL.  THE ACCRUAL PROGRAM MADE SURE ALL DAYS WERE
      *  CLOSED & UPDATED, AND EITHER WROTE OR RE-WROTE AN RC RECORD
      *  FOR THE MONTH-END DATE WITH A STATUS OF G1 FOR EARNINGS,
      *  SO THE ONLY CHECK DONE HERE IS THAT ALL BRANCHES HAVE A G1
      *  STATUS FOR THE MONTH-END DATE.
      *
      *  IF CUSTOMER IS CASH METHOD ONLY AND DOESN'T DO IB ACCRUALS
      *  (IF GP-CASH-METHOD-ONLY = "Y" AND GP-IB-ACCRUALS-DONE = "N"),
      *  THEN WE HAVEN'T CHECKED FOR OPEN DAYS YET.  THEREFORE, WE
      *  CALL CL/CKSTAT HERE TO VERIFY THERE ARE NO NON-UPDATED DAYS
      *  (RC-STATUS < D1).  ONCE THE STATUSES ARE CHECKED, THIS PROGRAM
      *  WRITES OR REWRITES AN RC RECORD FOR EACH BRANCH FOR THE
      *  MONTH-END DATE WITH A STATUS OF G1.  THEREFORE THIS UPDATE
      *  CAN PROCEED TO PROCESS CASH OR NON-CASH CUSTOMERS EXPECTING
      *  THE SAME STATUSES:  IN BOTH CASES THE RC-FILE IS STARTED
      *  WITH A STATUS OF G1 FOR THE MONTH-END DATE, & REWRITTEN
      *  WITH A STATUS OF I1 FOR MONTH-END UPDATED.
      *
      *  5/25/99 - THERE STILL IS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM IF A CUSTOMER
      *  WHO DOES NOT ACCRUE RUNS EOM WITH A DAY WHICH WAS NOT OPEN
      *  FOR LOAN PROCESSING. THIS SITUATION WOULD PASS THE STATUS
      *  CHECKS HERE (BECAUSE THERE IS NO RC FOR THE MONTH-END
      *  DATE), & THEN WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM
      *  DRIVES OFF RC.  I ADDED A FIRST-TIME CHECK TO GIVE A
      *  MSG IF NO BRANCHES PROCESSED HERE; ALSO, IF THE GLOBAL EOM
      *  CHECK FOR LONPA0 IS TURNED ON, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO OPEN
      *  THE FIRST DAY OF NEXT MONTH UNLESS THE FLAG IS TURNED ON. (BLV)
