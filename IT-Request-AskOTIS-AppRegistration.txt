Subject: Request: Azure AD App Registration for AskOTIS Static Web App

Hi IT Team,

I need assistance creating an Azure AD App Registration to enable authentication for our new internal application called "AskOTIS" hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.

**App Registration Details:**

**Name:** AskOTIS-Auth

**Supported Account Types:** Accounts in this organizational directory only (World Acceptance Corporation only - Single tenant)

**Redirect URIs (Web platform):**
- https://ambitious-ground-022e4a70f.3.azurestaticapps.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
- https://ambitious-ground-022e4a70f-preview.eastus2.3.azurestaticapps.net/.auth/login/aad/callback

**After creating the app registration, please provide me with:**
1. Application (client) ID
2. A client secret (with appropriate expiration period)
3. The secret value (note: this can only be viewed once upon creation)

**Additional Configuration:**
- No special API permissions are required beyond the default User.Read
- This will be used to restrict access to the AskOTIS application to only World Acceptance Corporation employees

**Background:**
This app registration is needed to implement Azure AD authentication for our internal AskOTIS application, ensuring that only authenticated users from our organization can access it.

**Azure Subscription:** World Azure Prod (00de2929-ebe2-437d-bae3-f66a78372346)
**Resource Group:** azure_ai_rg
**Static Web App Name:** AskOTIS

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you,
Jeff Childers
