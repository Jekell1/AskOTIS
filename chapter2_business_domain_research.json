    "question_number": 3,
    "question": "How does OTIS manage the complete loan lifecycle from origination to payoff?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) manages the complete loan lifecycle by orchestrating a series of specialized COBOL programs and routines that handle each major phase of a loan’s existence—from origination, through servicing, to final payoff. Here’s how OTIS covers each stage:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Loan Origination**\n- **Business Purpose:** Capture new loan applications, validate applicant data, calculate terms, and book loans into the system.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - Programs like **APILNS** handle loan creation, calling routines for calculations and restrictions (e.g., **CALCZL**, **LNVERI**).\n  - Origination involves creating log and data files for audit and compliance ([Source: [[FILE:APIDRV.CBL|APIDRV.CBL]], Index: code]).\n  - Data is validated, and if successful, the loan is added to the master files.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Loan Servicing**\n- **Business Purpose:** Manage ongoing loan activities such as payment processing, interest accrual, account maintenance, and customer inquiries.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - **Payment Processing:** Programs like **LONPFA**, **LONPFB**, and **LONPF2** handle payment posting, updating balances, and recalculating due dates.\n  - **Account Maintenance:** Programs such as **LONPS4** and **RESCHD** manage changes to loan terms, rescheduling, and modifications.\n  - **Inquiry and Reporting:** Inquiry programs (e.g., **CPINQ0**, **LONPF0**) allow users to view loan status, payment history, and account details.\n  - **Interest and Fee Calculations:** Specialized routines calculate interest accruals, late fees, and other charges.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Loan Payoff**\n- **Business Purpose:** Calculate final payoff amounts, process loan closure, and handle rebates or refunds.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - **Payoff Calculation:** Programs like **PAYOFF**, **LPPOFF**, and **WIPOFF** compute the exact payoff amount, including principal, accrued interest, and any applicable rebates ([Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]], Index: code]; [Source: [[FILE:PAYOFF.CBL|PAYOFF.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage]).\n  - **Final Processing:** These programs update the loan status to closed, generate payoff statements, and ensure all financial records are updated.\n  - **Rebate Handling:** Routines within **LPPOFF** and related programs calculate and apply insurance or interest rebates as required ([Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]], Index: code]).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Post-Payoff and Archival**\n- **Business Purpose:** Ensure all records are finalized, compliance is met, and data is archived for future reference.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - Programs update master files, generate audit logs, and may trigger archival routines.\n  - Reporting programs summarize closed loans for regulatory and business reporting.\n\n---\n\n## **Workflow Narrative Example**\n\n**Typical Loan Lifecycle in OTIS:**\n1. **Origination:**  \n   - User enters loan application → **APILNS** validates and books the loan.\n2. **Servicing:**  \n   - Customer makes payments → **LONPFA/LONPFB** post payments, update balances.\n   - Account changes (e.g., reschedule) → **RESCHD** processes modifications.\n   - Inquiries → **CPINQ0** displays loan/account status.\n3. **Payoff:**  \n   - Customer requests payoff → **PAYOFF/LPPOFF** calculate final amount.\n   - Payment received → Loan marked as paid off, rebates processed.\n4. **Closure:**  \n   - Records updated, reports generated, loan archived.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Programs and Their Roles**\n\n| Stage         | Key Programs      | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Origination   | APILNS           | Loan creation, validation, and booking                                      |\n| Servicing     | LONPFA, LONPFB   | Payment posting, balance updates                                            |\n|               | LONPS4, RESCHD   | Account maintenance, rescheduling, modifications                            |\n|               | CPINQ0, LONPF0   | Loan/account inquiry and reporting                                          |\n| Payoff        | PAYOFF, LPPOFF, WIPOFF | Payoff calculation, closure, rebate/refund processing                  |\n| Post-Payoff   | Reporting programs| Audit, compliance, and archival                                            |\n\n---\n\n## **Visual Representation: OTIS Loan Lifecycle Workflow**\n\nHere's a visual representation:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Loan Lifecycle Management</text>\n  \n  <!-- Origination -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"180\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#4ade80\" stroke=\"#16a34a\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"140\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#065f46\">Origination</text>\n  <text x=\"140\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#065f46\">APILNS</text>\n  \n  <!-- Servicing -->\n  <rect x=\"270\" y=\"80\" width=\"250\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"395\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#3730a3\">Servicing</text>\n  <text x=\"395\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3730a3\">LONPFA, LONPFB, LONPS4, RESCHD, CPINQ0</text>\n  \n  <!-- Payoff -->\n  <rect x=\"550\" y=\"80\" width=\"140\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#b45309\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#92400e\">Payoff</text>\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#92400e\">PAYOFF, LPPOFF, WIPOFF</text>\n  \n  <!-- Post-Payoff -->\n  <rect x=\"730\" y=\"80\" width=\"120\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#166534\">Post-Payoff</text>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#166534\">Reporting, Archival</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"230\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"270\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"520\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"550\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"690\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"730\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Stage labels -->\n  <text x=\"140\" y=\"180\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#065f46\">Application, Validation, Booking</text>\n  <text x=\"395\" y=\"180\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3730a3\">Payments, Maintenance, Inquiry</text>\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"180\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#92400e\">Payoff Calculation, Closure</text>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"180\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#166534\">Audit, Compliance, Archive</text>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n## **Source References**\n- Loan origination and validation: [Source: [[FILE:APIDRV.CBL|APIDRV.CBL]], Index: code], [Source: [[FILE:APILNS|APILNS]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows]\n- Payment processing and servicing: [Source: [[FILE:LONPFA|LONPFA]], [[FILE:LONPFB|LONPFB]], [[FILE:LONPS4|LONPS4]], [[FILE:RESCHD|RESCHD]], [[FILE:CPINQ0|CPINQ0]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows]\n- Payoff calculation and closure: [Source: [[FILE:PAYOFF|PAYOFF]], [[FILE:LPPOFF|LPPOFF]], [[FILE:WIPOFF|WIPOFF]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs, flows, code]\n- Rebate and final processing: [Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]], Index: code]\n- Reporting and archival: [Source: [[FILE:CLAST2.CBL|CLAST2.CBL]], Index: code]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nOTIS manages the loan lifecycle by coordinating specialized programs for each phase—origination, servicing, payoff, and closure—ensuring accurate processing, compliance, and robust record-keeping throughout the life of every loan.",

    "question": "How does OTIS handle interest calculation and accrual for different loan types?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) handles interest calculation and accrual for different loan types using a sophisticated set of COBOL programs and copybooks that implement multiple interest formulas, accrual methods, and business rules tailored to each loan product. Here’s how the system manages this process:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Accurately calculate interest charges and accrued interest for a wide variety of loan types (consumer, commercial, mortgage, revolving, etc.).\n- Support regulatory requirements and institution-specific rules for interest assessment, rebates, and payoff scenarios.\n- Ensure correct earnings recognition for both standard and special loan products.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n### 1. **Interest Calculation Formulas**\nOTIS supports numerous interest calculation methods, each suited to different loan types:\n\n- **Actuarial (Rule of 78, True Rebate, Proration):**\n  - Used for consumer loans, installment loans, and some commercial products.\n  - Example from [[FILE:LPAERN.CPY|LPAERN.CPY]]:\n    ```\n    * 58  (58) -  RULE 78    CASH LIQUIDATION IF PAID AHEAD OR\n    *                           TIME (ACCRUAL) IF DELINQUENCY\n    * 59  (59) -  REBATE     TRUE REBATE METHOD\n    * 60       -  ACTUARIAL    (MERCURY)\n    * 62       -  ACTUARIAL  PRORATION OF COMPONENT TO THE TOTAL YIELD\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LPAERN.CPY|LPAERN.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **Simple Interest:**\n  - Used for certain commercial and real estate loans.\n  - Example logic:\n    ```\n    IF COP-OVR-RATE-IS-APR OR SP-CAL-SIMPLE(CTBL)\n       MOVE WKS-RATE TO IWA-RATE\n       MOVE WKS-ANNUITY TO IWA-LOAN-ANNUITY\n    ELSE\n       PERFORM XBA-CALCULATE-SIMPLE-INTEREST\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:CALCZL.CBL|CALCZL.CBL]], Lines 3776-3800)\n\n- **Amortized Interest (Rate Type 'Z'):**\n  - Special handling for real estate loans, computes interest on a 30-day method.\n    ```\n    * ADDED NEW RATE TYPE 'Z' AMORTIZED WHERE RUNTIME COMPUTES\n    * INTEREST ON A 30 DAY METHOD (REAL ESTATE) AND LOAN CALCS\n    * ARE DONE SIMPLE\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]], Lines 51-75)\n\n- **Special Cases (Judgment, Acceleration, Reduction):**\n  - When loans are in judgment, accelerated, or reduced status, the system uses the date of the event to determine the correct interest assessed.\n    ```\n    * ADDED LOGIC TO USE THE CORRECT INTEREST ASSESSED THROUGH\n    * DATE WHEN THE LOAN IS EXPIRED AND IN JUDGMENT,\n    * ACCELERATED OR REDUCTION STATUS.\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LPRATE.CPY|LPRATE.CPY]], Lines 76-100)\n\n### 2. **Accrual Logic**\n- **Monthly/Periodic Accruals:**\n  - Interest is accrued based on the loan’s schedule and payment history.\n  - Special logic for paid-ahead, delinquent, or midstream purchase scenarios.\n    ```\n    * THE 1ST ACCRUAL WILL BE TAKEN AT THE END OF THE MONTH THE\n    * SAC PERIOD EXPIRES.\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LPAERN.CPY|LPAERN.CPY]], Lines 226-250)\n\n- **Handling of Add-ons and Upfront Charges:**\n  - Upfront service charges and add-on interest are handled distinctly, especially for Interest Bearing (IB) loans.\n    ```\n    * NEED TO TAKE UPFRONT SERVICE CHARGE FOR IB'S\n    UPD-INTYTD.\n       IF SP-1098FRMLA = \" \" OR \"B\"\n          COMPUTE LN-YTDINTPD = LN-ACCERN(1) + LN-ACCERN(2)\n                              + LN-ACCERN(3) + LN-ACCERN(4)\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LONPB2.CBL|LONPB2.CBL]], Lines 926-950)\n\n- **Maximum Accrual Days:**\n  - For IB loans, the system enforces a maximum accrual period.\n    ```\n    * IB COPUTES A MAX ACCRUAL BASED ON SP-MAX-IB-ACR-DAYS. IF THIS IS 0,\n    *   ITS DONE WITH THIS LOAN.\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:RZ3DAY.CBL|RZ3DAY.CBL]], Lines 26-50)\n\n### 3. **Program and Copybook Structure**\n- **Core Programs:**\n  - CALCZL: Central calculation engine for loan rates and payments.\n  - LPAERN: Handles earnings and accrual logic for various formulas.\n  - LPRATE: Manages rate calculations and special status handling.\n  - LPPOFF/LFPPO: Handles payoff calculations, including interest refund/due for amortized loans.\n\n- **Key Copybooks:**\n  - [[FILE:LPAERN.CPY|LPAERN.CPY]] – Defines earnings formulas and accrual logic.\n  - [[FILE:LPRATE.CPY|LPRATE.CPY]] – Contains rate calculation rules and status handling.\n  - [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]] – Manages rate types and special calculation methods.\n  - [[FILE:LPCERN.CPY|LPCERN.CPY]] – Details actuarial and time-based interest calculations.\n\n### 4. **Conditional Logic and Business Rules**\n- The system uses IF/EVALUATE statements to select the correct formula and accrual method based on:\n  - Loan type (consumer, commercial, mortgage, revolving, etc.)\n  - Status (active, paid ahead, delinquent, judgment, accelerated, reduced)\n  - Product-specific parameters (rate type, formula code, max accrual days)\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY TABLE: Interest Calculation Methods by Loan Type**\n\n| Loan Type         | Formula/Method         | Key Programs/Copybooks         | Special Handling                |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Consumer Loans    | Rule of 78, True Rebate, Actuarial | LPAERN, LPRATE, [[FILE:LPCERN.CPY|LPCERN.CPY]] | Paid ahead, delinquency logic   |\n| Commercial Loans  | Simple Interest, Actuarial        | CALCZL, LPRATE, [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]]  | Upfront charges, max accrual    |\n| Mortgage Loans    | Amortized ('Z' Rate Type), Simple | LPPOFF, LFPPO, [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]]   | 30-day method, payoff logic     |\n| Revolving Credit  | Special IB formulas, Max accrual  | LPAERN, RZ3DAY, [[FILE:LONPB2.CBL|LONPB2.CBL]]  | Max IB accrual days enforced    |\n\n---\n\n**EXAMPLE CODE SNIPPET:**\n```cobol\nIF SP-ERNFRMLA = 58\n   PERFORM RULE-78-CALCULATION\nELSE IF SP-ERNFRMLA = 59\n   PERFORM TRUE-REBATE-CALCULATION\nELSE IF SP-ERNFRMLA = 60 OR 62\n   PERFORM ACTUARIAL-CALCULATION\n...\nIF LN-LOANTYPE = \"M\" AND SP-CAL-RATETYPE = \"Z\"\n   CALL 'LFPPO' USING PAYOFF-DATA\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:LPAERN.CPY|LPAERN.CPY]], [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]], [[FILE:LFPPO.CBL|LFPPO.CBL]])\n\n---\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nOTIS’s interest calculation and accrual logic is highly configurable and supports a broad spectrum of loan products. It selects the appropriate formula and accrual method based on loan type, status, and business rules, ensuring accurate financial processing for each account.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual

    "question": "What escrow account management functions does OTIS support?",
    "answer": "OTIS supports comprehensive escrow account management functions for loan accounts, enabling financial institutions to handle all aspects of escrow throughout the loan lifecycle. Here’s a summary of the key escrow management capabilities provided by OTIS:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- **Escrow Collection:** OTIS tracks and collects escrow payments from borrowers as part of regular loan payments. These funds are set aside for specific purposes such as property taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premiums.\n- **Escrow Disbursement:** The system manages disbursement of escrow funds to pay third-party obligations (e.g., tax authorities, insurance companies) when due.\n- **Escrow Balance Tracking:** OTIS maintains detailed records of escrow balances, scheduled escrow amounts, amounts collected, and amounts disbursed for each loan account.\n- **Escrow Reversal & Adjustment:** Supports reversal of escrow transactions (e.g., when payments are reversed or corrected), and adjustment of escrow balances when necessary.\n- **Prepaid Escrow Handling:** Manages prepaid escrow transactions, allowing for early or additional escrow payments and updating account records accordingly.\n- **Escrow Status & Flags:** Tracks escrow status flags (active/inactive), outstanding scheduled escrow, and changes to escrow status based on account activity.\n- **Error Handling & Messaging:** Provides error messages and prompts when escrow records are missing, balances are insufficient, or transactions are invalid (e.g., attempting to post escrow transactions to accounts without escrow).\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\nOTIS implements these functions using a combination of COBOL programs and data structures:\n\n- **Key Programs:**\n  - **ESCROW:** Central program for escrow management (Source: [[FILE:ESCROW|ESCROW]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs)\n  - **LONPF2, LONPFC, LONPF1, LONPQ1, LONPFE:** Loan processing programs with embedded escrow logic\n\n- **Core Data Structures:**\n  - **ES-ESCROW-SCHEDULE ([[FILE:LP01ES.CPY|LP01ES.CPY]]):** Tracks scheduled escrow payments, effective dates, first payment dates, amounts, terms, and collected amounts (Source: [[FILE:LP01ES.CPY|LP01ES.CPY]], Index: code)\n  - **ES-BALANCE:** Current escrow balance for the account\n  - **ES-STAT-TABLE:** Tracks prepaid, collected, and disbursed escrow amounts for YTD, last YTD, and loan-to-date (Source: [[FILE:LP01ES.CPY|LP01ES.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **Main Functions:**\n  - **Opening/Reading/Writing Escrow Records:**\n    - Programs perform OPEN-ES1-FILE, READ-ES1-FILE, REWRITE-ES1-FILE, and CLOSE-ES1-FILE to manage escrow data (Source: [[FILE:LONPF2.CBL|LONPF2.CBL]], Index: code)\n  - **Applying Payments to Escrow:**\n    - Adds payment amounts to

    "question_number": 7,
    "question": "How does OTIS process late fees, penalties, and default scenarios?",
    "answer": "OTIS processes late fees, penalties, and default scenarios using a coordinated set of COBOL routines and copybooks that implement complex business rules for loan servicing. Here’s a breakdown of how these functions are handled:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Late Fees:** OTIS automatically assesses late charges when payments are overdue, using formulas tailored to loan type, payment history, and regulatory requirements.\n- **Penalties:** Additional charges or adjustments are applied for specific delinquency or default conditions, such as exceeding grace periods or failing to meet contractual obligations.\n- **Default Scenarios:** The system tracks loans that enter default status, recalculates amounts owed, and applies appropriate penalties and late charges, ensuring compliance and accurate accounting.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### 1. **Late Fee Assessment**\n\n- **Routine:** The main logic for late charge calculation is in the copybook `[[FILE:LPLCHG.CPY|LPLCHG.CPY]]` and the apply routine `[[FILE:LPLCAP.CPY|LPLCAP.CPY]]`.\n- **Process:**\n  - The system checks if a payment is late by comparing payment dates to due dates and grace periods.\n  - If late, it calculates the late charge using formulas based on loan type (`SP-LCTYPE`), amount overdue, and maintenance fees.\n  - Example logic (Source: [[FILE:LPLCHG.CPY|LPLCHG.CPY]], Lines 176-200):\n    ```cobol\n    IF SP-LCTYPE = \"O\"\n       IF LCHG-LATE > (LN-REGPYAMT - LN-MAINTFEE)\n          COMPUTE LCHG-LATE = LN-REGPYAMT - LN-MAINTFEE.\n\n    IF SP-LCTYPE = \"N\"\n       COMPUTE LCHG-TRUNC = LCHG-LATE - LN-MAINTFEE\n       COMPUTE LCHG-CHARGE ROUNDED = LCHG-TRUNC * SP-LCRATE /100.\n    ```\n    - This shows different formulas for different loan types.\n\n- **Assessment Checks:** Before applying a late charge, the system performs checks:\n  - Is the payment past maturity? (Source: [[FILE:LPLCAP.CPY|LPLCAP.CPY]], Lines 751-775)\n  - Has the late charge already been brought up to date?\n  - Is the amount overdue less than the delinquency factor?\n\n### 2. **Penalty Application**\n\n- **Routine:** Penalties are managed in routines like `[[FILE:PENALT.CBL|PENALT.CBL]]` (uses `[[FILE:GETFMW.CPY|GETFMW.CPY]]` for penalty formulas).\n- **Process:**\n  - Penalties may be assessed for specific events, such as default or repeated late payments.\n  - The system computes penalty amounts and applies them to the loan balance.\n\n### 3. **Default Handling**\n\n- **Routine:** Default scenarios are processed in routines such as `[[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]]` and `[[FILE:LPLCAP.CPY|LPLCAP.CPY]]`.\n- **Process:**\n  - When a loan enters default, the system recalculates all amounts due, including principal, interest, late charges, and penalties.\n  - Example logic (Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]], Lines 401-425):\n    ```cobol\n    IF IBPC-FG = \"P\" AND IBPC-EXPIRED-FLAG = \" \"\n       PERFORM PAYOFF-SET-INT-CHARGES\n       PERFORM PAYOFF-SET-LATE-CHARGES.\n    ```\n    - This shows how late charges and interest are recalculated for payoffs in default scenarios.\n\n- **Late Charge Calculation in Payoff:** (Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]], Lines 676-700)\n    ```cobol\n    PAYOFF-SET-LATE-CHARGES SECTION.\n       MOVE POFF-PAYDATE TO LCAP-PAYDATE.\n       MOVE LN-1STPYDATE TO LCAP-1STPYDATE.\n       MOVE \"AL\" TO LCAP-LPTRCD.\n    ```\n    - The system sets up the context for late charge calculation during payoff.\n\n### 4. **Business Rule Documentation**\n\n- The routines include extensive comments documenting regulatory and business policy changes, such as:\n  - \"ASSESS A LATE CHARGE EVEN IF ACCOUNT IS PAID AHEAD\" (Source: [[FILE:LPLCAP.CPY|LPLCAP.CPY]], Lines 126-150)\n  - \"CAN'T TAKE LATE CHARGE ON MONIES PAID WITHIN GRACE DAYS OF DUE DAY\" (Source: [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], Lines 2601-2625)\n\n---\n\n**KEY PROGRAMS AND COPYBOOKS INVOLVED**\n\n| Program/Copybook      | Description                                                        |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [[FILE:LPLCAP.CPY|LPLCAP.CPY]]            | Late charge apply routine: determines late charge, deficiency, etc.|\n| [[FILE:LPLCHG.CPY|LPLCHG.CPY]]            | Late charge calculation formulas for different loan types.          |\n| [[FILE:LPPOFF.CBL|LPPOFF.CBL]]            | Payoff routine: recalculates charges and penalties at payoff.      |\n| [[FILE:PENALT.CBL|PENALT.CBL]]            | Penalty calculation and application logic.                         |\n| [[FILE:GETFMW.CPY|GETFMW.CPY]]            | Penalty formula definitions.                                       |\n\n---\n\n**PROCESS FLOW SUMMARY**\n\n1. **Payment Due Date Reached**\n2. **System Checks for Delinquency**\n   -

    "question": "How does OTIS manage loan modifications, refinancing, and restructuring?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages loan modifications, refinancing, and restructuring through a set of specialized COBOL programs and routines that guide users through the process, enforce business rules, and update all relevant loan records. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how these functions are implemented:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Loan Modifications:** OTIS allows users to change loan terms (e.g., interest rate, payment schedule, maturity date) in response to borrower requests or financial hardship.\n- **Refinancing:** The system supports payoff and re-issuance of loans, updating principal, interest, and other terms as required.\n- **Restructuring:** OTIS can adjust loans due to default, regulatory requirements, or negotiated settlements, including changes to payment plans, interest rates, and fees.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### 1. **User Workflow**\n\n- Users initiate modifications via dedicated screens (e.g., RESCHD, LONPS4, LONPF3).\n- The system prompts for new terms, validates input, and enforces constraints (such as allowable changes and regulatory limits).\n\n### 2. **Core Programs and Flow**\n\n- **RESCHD (Reschedule/Restructure):**\n  - Handles entry of new loan terms, payment schedules, and restructuring details.\n  - Flow includes modules for resetting forms, entering keys, updating files, and scanning borrower loans.\n  - **Source:** RESCHD, Index: flows\n\n- **LONPS4 (Loan Change Processing):**\n  - Manages changes to loan records, including promised payments and actions.\n  - Flow includes routines for modifying messages, promised amounts, and actions.\n  - **Source:** LONPS4, Index: flows\n\n- **LONPF3 (Payment File Modification):**\n  - Supports changes to payment files and loan records.\n  - Flow includes routines for displaying transaction records, restoring screens, and processing loan changes.\n  - **Source:** LONPF3, Index: flows\n\n- **LPPOFF (Payoff and Refinancing):**\n  - Handles loan payoff calculations, rebate processing, and creation of new loan records for refinancing.\n  - Includes routines for setting charges, calculating rebates, and updating loan status.\n  - **Source:** LPPOFF, Index: flows\n\n### 3. **Business Rule Enforcement**\n\n- **Validation:** Each program enforces business rules such as:\n  - Only certain fields can be modified (e.g., interest rate, payment amount).\n  - Regulatory checks (e.g., maximum allowable interest rate, required disclosures).\n  - Restrictions on changes (e.g., cannot modify loan date or proceeds after origination).\n  - **Example:** In LONPG5, code comments specify that changes to SRCD, LOANDATE, and PROCEEDS are not allowed during modification.\n    - *Source: [[FILE:LONPG5.CBL|LONPG5.CBL]], Lines 451-475*\n\n- **Element Specifications:** Programs use MAX and SPEC-TABLE constructs to limit the number and type of modifications per transaction.\n  - *Example:* CHDUAL, CHORIG, CHDEBT all use a MAX value to restrict how many elements (fields) can be changed in a single operation.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:CHDUAL.CBL|CHDUAL.CBL]], Lines 126-150; [[FILE:CHORIG.CBL|CHORIG.CBL]], Lines 101-125; [[FILE:CHDEBT.CBL|CHDEBT.CBL]], Lines 101-125*\n\n### 4. **File and Data Updates**\n\n- Upon successful validation, the system updates loan master files, payment schedules, and audit logs.\n- All changes are tracked for compliance and reporting.\n\n### 5. **Audit and Compliance**\n\n- Modifications trigger updates to audit trails and compliance reports, ensuring regulatory requirements are met.\n- Programs like LONPF3 and LPPOFF integrate with reporting modules to reflect changes in financial statements.\n\n---\n\n**EXAMPLE WORKFLOW NARRATIVE**\n\n1. **User selects “Loan Modification” from the OTIS menu.**\n2. **RESCHD screen appears:** User enters new terms (e.g., payment amount, due date).\n3. **System validates input:** Only allowed fields can be changed; regulatory checks are performed.\n4. **LONPS4 processes changes:** Updates loan record, recalculates payment schedule, logs changes.\n5. **LPPOFF handles refinancing:** If loan is paid off and reissued, calculates payoff, creates new loan record.\n6. **Audit trail updated:** All changes are logged for compliance.\n7. **Reporting modules reflect changes:** Financial and regulatory reports are updated.\n\n---\n\n**KEY PROGRAMS INVOLVED**\n\n| Program   | Purpose

    "question": "What collections and delinquency management processes does OTIS support?",
    "answer": "OTIS supports a comprehensive set of collections and delinquency management processes designed for loan servicing and financial institutions. These processes are implemented through specialized COBOL programs, copybooks, and business logic that automate the tracking, reporting, and resolution of delinquent accounts.\n\n### Collections and Delinquency Management Processes in OTIS\n\n#### 1. **Delinquency Calculation and Tracking**\n- **Arrearage and Delinquency Computation:**  \n  OTIS calculates arrearages and delinquency status for each loan account using routines that consider payment schedules, current balances, and contractual terms.\n  - Example:  \n    - **LPTDEL** and **LPCDEL** programs and copybooks contain logic to compute account arrearage and set delinquency flags.  \n      - Comments show ongoing enhancements to accurately produce arrearage and handle maturity checks.  \n      - (Source: [[FILE:LPTDEL.CPY|LPTDEL.CPY]], [[FILE:LPCDEL.CPY|LPCDEL.CPY]], Index: code)\n  - **Past Due Days Calculation:**  \n    - **LPPDUE** computes the number of days an account is past due, supporting aging analysis for collections.  \n      - (Source: [[FILE:LPPDUE|LPPDUE]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n#### 2. **Collections Workflow and Reporting**\n- **Collections Assist Screens:**  \n  - **COLAST** provides a user interface for collections staff to view and manage delinquent accounts, integrating with inquiry and payment posting workflows.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:COLAST.CBL|COLAST.CBL]], Index: code)\n- **Collection Letter Generation:**  \n  - **COLLET** automates the creation of collection letters for delinquent accounts, including date range checks and totals routines.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:COLLET.CBL|COLLET.CBL]], Index: code)\n- **Delinquency Reports:**  \n  - **COLRPT** and **COLRP2** generate detailed reports on delinquent accounts, including worked account flags and collector activity tracking.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n#### 3. **Business Rule Enforcement**\n- **Allowable Delinquency Policy Validation:**  \n  - OTIS enforces maximum allowable delinquency policies, blocking actions when thresholds are exceeded.\n    - Example:  \n      - **LONPF1** validates against maximums and sets error messages if limits are breached.  \n      - (Source: [[FILE:LONPF1.CBL|LONPF1.CBL]], Index: code)\n- **Contractual vs. Actual Delinquency:**  \n  - **LPCDEL** distinguishes between contractual delinquency (based on payment schedule) and actual arrearage, ensuring accurate status assignment.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:LPCDEL.CPY|LPCDEL.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n#### 4. **Special Handling Scenarios**\n- **Bankruptcy and Non-Accrual Accounts:**  \n  - Programs like **PROGRP** adjust delinquency calculations for bankrupt accounts, ensuring correct reporting and compliance.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]], Index: code)\n- **Bulk Purchase and Repo Handling:**  \n  - Logic in **LONIF1** manages delinquency updates for bulk purchase transactions and repossessed accounts, reversing out certain balances as needed.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:LONIF1.CBL|LONIF1.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n#### 5. **Dealer and Addon Delinquency**\n- **Dealer Delinquency Management:**  \n  - Programs such as **RZMALL** and **BWVDEL** handle delinquency tracking for dealer accounts, including special routines for non-accrual and outstanding dealer stats.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:RZMALL.CBL|RZMALL.CBL]], BWVDEL, Index: code/flows)\n- **Addon Contract Delinquency:**  \n  - **LPDLCL** and related routines manage delinquency for addon contracts, ensuring all components of a loan are tracked.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:LPDLCL|LPDLCL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n#### 6. **Integration with Other Loan Servicing Functions**\n- **Interaction with Payment Posting and Inquiries:**  \n  - Collections routines are integrated with payment posting (e.g., F11 from posting date triggers collections assist screens) and account inquiry modules for seamless workflow.  \n    - (Source: [[FILE:COLAST.CBL|COLAST.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n---\n\n### Visual Representation: Collections & Delinquency Management Architecture\n\nHere's a visual representation of the key components and their relationships:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"600\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Collections & Delinquency Management</text>\n  \n  <!-- Collections Workflow Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"70\" width=\"800\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"95\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Collections Workflow</text>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#4338ca\">COLAST (Assist Screen)</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#4338ca\">COLLET (Letter Generation)</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#4338ca\">COLRPT/COLRP2 (Reporting)</text>\n  \n  <!-- Delinquency Calculation Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"200\" width=\"800\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"225\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Delinquency Calculation</text>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"260\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#1e40af\">LPTDEL / LPCDEL (Arrearage)</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"260\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#1e40af\">LPPDUE (Past Due Days)</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"260\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#1e40af\">LONPF1 (Policy Validation)</text>\n  \n  <!-- Special Handling Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"330\" width=\"800\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"355\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Special Handling</text>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"390\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#15803d\">PROGRP (Bankruptcy)</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"390\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#15803d\">LONIF1 (Bulk/Repo)</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"390\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#15803d\">RZMALL/BWVDEL (Dealer)</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows between layers -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrow\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#666\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"170\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"300\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"330\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n### Source Citations\n\n- [[FILE:LPTDEL.CPY|LPTDEL.CPY]], [[FILE:LPCDEL.CPY|LPCDEL.CPY]] – Arrearage and delinquency computation logic (Source: [[FILE:LPTDEL.CPY|LPTDEL.CPY]], [[FILE:LPCDEL.CPY|LPCDEL.CPY]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:COLAST.CBL|COLAST.CBL]] – Collections assist screen integration (Source: [[FILE:COLAST.CBL|COLAST.CBL]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:COLLET.CBL|COLLET.CBL]] – Collection letter generation routines (Source: [[FILE:COLLET.CBL|COLLET.CBL]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]] – Delinquency reporting and collector activity tracking (Source: [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:LONPF1.CBL|LONPF1.CBL]] – Allowable delinquency policy enforcement (Source: [[FILE:LONPF1.CBL|LONPF1.CBL]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]] – Bankruptcy handling in delinquency calculations (Source: [[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]], Index: code)\n- [[FILE:RZMALL.CBL|RZMALL.CBL]], BWVDEL – Dealer delinquency management (Source: [[FILE:RZMALL.CBL|RZMALL.CBL]], BWVDEL, Index: code/flows)\n- LPPDUE – Past due days calculation (Source: [[FILE:LPPDUE|LPPDUE]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- LPDLCL – Addon contract delinquency management (Source: [[FILE:LPDLCL|LPDLCL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nOTIS automates collections and delinquency management through calculation routines, reporting modules, business rule enforcement, and special handling for complex scenarios (bankruptcy, bulk, dealer, addon contracts).

    "answer": "OTIS handles loan payoff calculations and final settlements through a coordinated set of COBOL programs, copybooks, and routines that ensure accurate computation of payoff amounts, proper application of rebates, fees, and interest, and compliance with business rules for final loan closure.\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Accurately determine the amount required to pay off a loan, including principal, accrued interest, late charges, and any applicable rebates or fees.\n- Support final settlements by updating all related records, generating payoff statements, and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n- Provide users (loan officers, customer service reps) with tools to process payoffs, validate calculations, and finalize loan accounts.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n### 1. **Core Programs Involved**\n- **PAYOFF**: Main program for calculating loan payoff amounts.\n- **LPPOFF**: Handles detailed payoff routines, including overrides and rebate calculations.\n- **GP-PAYOFF-NONCASH**: Manages non-cash payoff scenarios.\n- **LOAN**: Provides loan data for calculations.\n\n(Source: [[FILE:PAYOFF|PAYOFF]], [[FILE:LPPOFF|LPPOFF]], [[FILE:GP-PAYOF|GP-PAYOF]]F-NONCASH, LOAN, Index: programs/flows)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Calculation Workflow**\n\n**Step-by-step process:**\n1. **Initiation**: User requests a payoff quote or initiates a final settlement.\n2. **Data Gathering**: The system retrieves loan details (principal, interest, fees, payment history).\n3. **Payoff Calculation**:\n   - **Principal Balance**: Current outstanding principal.\n   - **Accrued Interest**: Interest calculated up to the payoff date.\n   - **Late Charges & Fees**: Any outstanding charges are added.\n   - **Rebates**: Applicable rebates (e.g., unearned insurance, finance charges) are computed and subtracted.\n   - **Overrides**: Special business rules or overrides (e.g., regulatory adjustments) are applied.\n4. **Final Amount**: The net payoff amount is computed, ensuring all components are included.\n5. **Settlement**: Upon payment, the system updates loan records, closes the account, and generates final statements.\n\n**Example Calculation Logic:**\n```cobol\nCOMPUTE NET-POFF-PRIN =\n   LN-CURBAL - LN-OT2BAL + LN-OTHBAL - TOT-POFF-REBATES.\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:APIPAY.CBL|APIPAY.CBL]], Lines 1001-1025)\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Key Routines and Paragraphs**\n- **PAYOFF-LOAN-ROUTINE**: Central routine for calculating payoff.\n- **REB-LN-DF-REBATE**: Calculates rebates and applies them to the payoff.\n- **PAYOFF-SET-INT-CHARGES / PAYOFF-SET-LATE-CHARGES**: Add interest and late charges.\n- **GB-PATH-OVERRIDE**: Applies business rule overrides.\n\n(Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF|LPPOFF]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Copybooks Used**\nPAYOFF uses a comprehensive set of copybooks to structure data and enforce business rules.

    "question": "What credit bureau reporting and integration capabilities does OTIS have?",
    "answer": "OTIS provides robust credit bureau reporting and integration capabilities to support financial institutions in managing borrower credit data, regulatory compliance, and automated data exchange with major bureaus. These capabilities are implemented through dedicated COBOL programs, specialized routines, and structured data flows.\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Automates the reporting of borrower credit information to bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)\n- Supports regulatory compliance for credit reporting (e.g., Metro2 format)\n- Enables periodic uploads/updates of credit scores and borrower data\n- Integrates bureau responses and updates into borrower and loan records\n- Facilitates credit score updates for new accounts and ongoing servicing\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Credit Bureau Reporting Programs:**\n   - **CHTRWF**: Handles credit bureau reporting, specifically triggered from the collections menu (CLMENU). According to program comments, it is dedicated to credit bureau reporting and only called from CLMENU.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:CHTRWF.CBL|CHTRWF.CBL]], Index: code*\n   - **WRLDCR**: Uploads credit scores into borrower records and updates loan credit scores for new accounts. It processes input files from external sources (e.g., /USR/DATA/R#/SP/OCORE.Y) and updates both borrower and loan files.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:WRLDCR.CBL|WRLDCR.CBL]], Index: code*\n   - **METRO2**: Implements Metro2 credit bureau reporting format, including logic for formatting account numbers, handling address segments, and bankruptcy reporting. It uses specialized copybooks for Metro2 data structures and includes historical notes about compliance with bureau requirements.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:METRO2.CBL|METRO2.CBL]], Index: code, copybook_usage*\n\n2. **Integration with Bureau Data:**\n   - Programs read and write files containing credit scores, credit limits, and bureau-specific fields (e.g., BW_CREDIT_SCORE, BW_CRED_SCORE_1-4, BW_BNKRPT_SCORE_1-4).\n     - *Source: [[FILE:IOBWRN.CBL|IOBWRN.CBL]], Index: code*\n   - Data structures are designed to accommodate multiple bureau scores and identifiers, supporting integration with all major bureaus.\n\n3. **Copybooks Supporting Bureau Integration:**\n   - **LIBSP/[[FILE:SP01TRWINFO.CPY|SP01TRWINFO.CPY]]**: Defines TransUnion/Metro2 reporting fields.\n   - **LIBGB/[[FILE:REBATE.CPY|REBATE.CPY]]** and **LIBGB/[[FILE:REBATEW.CPY|REBATEW.CPY]]**: Support rebate and credit score data structures.\n   - **[[FILE:TWINFO.CBL|TWINFO.CBL]]**: Specifies bureau program identifiers and reporter information for Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:METRO2.CBL|METRO2.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage; [[FILE:TWINFO.CBL|TWINFO.CBL]], Index: code*\n\n4. **Menu Integration:**\n   - Credit bureau reporting is accessible via the collections menu (CLMENU), allowing users to trigger reporting routines directly from the UI.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:CHTRWF.CBL|CHTRWF.CBL]], Index: code*\n\n5. **Automated Data Exchange:**\n   - Programs like WRLDCR and METRO2 automate the upload and formatting of credit data, ensuring compatibility with bureau requirements (e.g., right-justified, zero-filled account numbers).\n   - Historical comments document changes made to comply with bureau specifications and regulatory updates.\n     - *Source: [[FILE:METRO2.CBL|METRO2.CBL]], Index: code*\n\n**KEY PROGRAMS AND FILES INVOLVED:**\n\n| Program   | Purpose/Role

    "question": "How does OTIS manage insurance tracking and forced-placed insurance?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages insurance tracking and forced-placed insurance through a combination of business rules, COBOL programs, and copybooks that ensure loans are properly monitored for insurance compliance, and that forced-placed insurance is applied when required. Here’s how the process works:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Insurance Tracking:**  \n  OTIS tracks insurance coverage for each loan, monitoring whether required insurance types (e.g., collateral, property, credit life, accident/health, etc.) are present and valid. This ensures regulatory compliance and protects the lender’s collateral.\n- **Forced-Placed Insurance:**  \n  If a borrower fails to maintain required insurance, OTIS can automatically apply forced-placed insurance to the loan. This protects the lender by ensuring coverage is in place, even if the borrower is non-compliant.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### 1. **Insurance Tracking Logic**\n\n- **Loan Record Fields:**  \n  Insurance status is tracked in loan record fields such as `LN-INSTYPES-PP`, `LN-INSPREM`, and others. These indicate which insurance types are present and their premiums.\n- **Insurance Tracking Routines:**  \n  Programs like `DISPLAY-INSURANCE-TRACKING` (found in [[FILE:LONPF0.CBL|LONPF0.CBL]]) read insurance data from loan records and associated insurance tracking files (e.g., LTA1-FILE), displaying current insurance status and details.\n\n  Example (Source: [[FILE:LONPF0.CBL|LONPF0.CBL]], Index: code):\n  ```cobol\n  DISPLAY-INSURANCE-TRACKING.\n      MOVE LN-OWNBR  TO LTA-BRNO.\n      MOVE LN-ACCTNO TO LTA-ACCTNO.\n      MOVE 1         TO LTA-SEQNO.\n      PERFORM OPEN-LTA1-FILE.\n      PERFORM READ-LTA1-FILE.\n      PERFORM CLOSE-LTA1-FILE.\n      IF IO-FG = 0\n         MOVE LTA-TRACK-ONLY TO D-TRACK\n         MOVE LTA-INSURANCE  TO D-INS\n      ELSE\n         MOVE SPACES TO D-TRACK D-INS.\n  ```\n\n- **Validation and Error Handling:**  \n  Programs like `SFVERI` validate insurance premiums and types, ensuring that property insurance is only allowed when appropriate and that premiums match the insurance type flags.\n\n  Example (Source: [[FILE:SFVERI.CBL|SFVERI.CBL]], Index: code):\n  ```cobol\n  IF LN-INSPREM(3) = 0\n     MOVE \"PROP PREMIUM DOES NOT MATCH INS TYPE FLAG\" TO MESS\n     PERFORM ERROR-MESSAGE\n  ELSE\n     IF ( LN-INSTYPES-PP )\n        IF ( SP-INSCOM(6) = ZEROES )\n           MOVE \"PROPERTY INSURANCE NOT ALLOWED\" TO MESS\n           PERFORM ERROR-MESSAGE.\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Forced-Placed Insurance Logic**\n\n- **Business Rules for Forced Placement:**  \n  Comments in [[FILE:XONPC0.CBL|XONPC0.CBL]] and [[FILE:ZONPC0.CBL|ZONPC0.CBL]] describe the rules for when forced-placed insurance is applied and how fees are locked/unlocked based on insurance status.\n\n  Example (Source: [[FILE:XONPC0.CBL|XONPC0.CBL]], Index: code):\n  ```\n  *    BR-FORCE | INSURANCE |\n  *      'Y'    |    'Y'    | FEES 16 -18 LOCKED\n  *      'Y'    |    'N'    | ALL FEES UNLOCKED, NO INSURANCE ENTRY ALLOWED\n  *      'N'    |    'N'    | ALL FEES UNLOCKED, NO INSURANCE ENTRY\n  ```\n\n- **Programmatic Enforcement:**  \n  If insurance is missing or invalid, the system sets flags (e.g., `BR-FORCE = 'Y'`) and restricts user actions (locking certain fee fields, preventing insurance entry, etc.). This ensures forced-placed insurance is applied according to business rules.\n\n- **Password Protection and Audit:**  \n  Certain insurance fields (CL, AH, PP, O1) are password-protected to prevent unauthorized changes, especially when forced-placed insurance is involved (Source: [[FILE:LNQUOT.CBL|LNQUOT.CBL]], [[FILE:XONPC0.CBL|XONPC0.CBL]]).\n\n### 3. **Insurance Tracking Files and Copybooks**\n\n- **Tracking Files:**  \n  Files like `LTA1-FILE` store insurance tracking records linked to loans.\n- **Copybooks:**  \n  - `[[FILE:LP01LT.CPY|LP01LT.CPY]]` – Defines insurance info fields for loan records.\n  - `[[FILE:LPIEXP.CPY|LPIEXP.CPY]]` – Handles insurance effective/expiration dates and commission calculations.\n  - `[[FILE:LP01SP.CPY|LP01SP.CPY]]` – Contains insurance calculation formulas and business rules.\n\n---\n\n**KEY PROGRAMS INVOLVED**\n\n| Program   | Purpose                                                        |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LONPF0    | Displays and manages insurance tracking for loans              |\n| SFVERI    | Validates insurance premiums and types                         |\n| XONPC0    | Enforces forced-placed insurance rules and fee locking         |\n| LNQUOT    | Handles insurance field protection and password logic          |\n| [[FILE:LP01LT.CPY|LP01LT.CPY]]| Defines insurance info fields for loan records                 |\n| [[FILE:LPIEXP.CPY|LPIEXP.CPY]]| Manages insurance dates and commission calculations            |\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS RULES (from code comments):**\n\n- If forced-placed insurance is required (`BR-FORCE = 'Y'`), certain fees are locked and insurance entry is restricted.\n- No insurance means certain fields are set to 'N' and entry is blocked.\n- Password protection is enforced for key insurance fields to prevent unauthorized changes.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nOTIS manages insurance tracking by:\n- Monitoring insurance status for every loan\n- Validating insurance coverage and premiums\n- Automatically applying forced-placed insurance when required\n- Enforcing business rules through field locking and password protection\n- Using dedicated COBOL programs and copybooks for insurance logic and tracking\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\"

    "question_number": 15,
    "question": "How does OTIS handle charge-offs, write-offs, and loss mitigation?",
    "answer": "OTIS handles charge-offs, write-offs, and loss mitigation through a coordinated set of COBOL programs, business rules, and data structures designed to:\n\n- Identify loans that meet charge-off or write-off criteria\n- Calculate and record charge-off amounts\n- Track loss mitigation activities and outcomes\n- Report on charge-offs for regulatory and management purposes\n\nBelow is a detailed explanation of how these processes are implemented in OTIS, with supporting code and business logic references.\n\n---\n\n## BUSINESS PURPOSE\n\n**Charge-offs and Write-offs:**\n- **Charge-off:** When a loan is deemed uncollectible, the outstanding balance is moved from an asset to an expense account, reflecting a loss.\n- **Write-off:** Similar to charge-off, but may refer to the accounting action of removing the asset from the books.\n- **Loss Mitigation:** Activities to reduce losses, such as restructuring, settlements, or recoveries after charge-off.\n\n**OTIS Objectives:**\n- Automate identification and processing of loans for charge-off/write-off\n- Ensure compliance with accounting and regulatory standards\n- Provide accurate reporting for management and auditors\n- Support loss mitigation tracking and reporting\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### 1. **Identification and Processing of Charge-offs**\n\n- **Business Rules:**  \n  OTIS uses date-based and status-based rules to determine when a loan should be charged off. For example:\n  - Loans with no payment activity for a set period (e.g., 90+ days delinquent)\n  - Loans meeting specific criteria (e.g., bankruptcy, repossession, or foreclosure)\n\n- **Code Example:**  \n  The following logic from `[[FILE:RZLNEXOLD.CBL|RZLNEXOLD.CBL]]` and `[[FILE:LNEXTR.CBL|LNEXTR.CBL]]` shows how loans are evaluated for charge-off eligibility:\n  ```cobol\n  * TEST P&L FROM DATE, IF LN-PLDATE IS PRIOR TO THIS DATE, SKIP\n  * BUT ONLY IF DATE OF LAST PAYMENT IS OLDER THAN +3 YEARS FROM\n  * PL-FROM-DATE\n  IF LN-PLDATE NOT = 0\n     IF LN-PLDATE < PL-FROM-DATE\n        IF LN-DATE-PAID-LAST = 0\n           ...\n  ```\n  - This logic ensures only loans with sufficiently old last payment dates are considered for charge-off.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:RZLNEXOLD.CBL|RZLNEXOLD.CBL]], Lines 501-525; [[FILE:LNEXTR.CBL|LNEXTR.CBL]], Lines 526-550)\n\n### 2. **Calculation and Recording of Charge-off Amounts**\n\n- **Data Structures:**  \n  Charge-off amounts are tracked monthly and year-to-date, as seen in `[[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]]`:\n  ```cobol\n  07  REPO-GAIN-AMT-MTD     PIC S9(11)V99 COMP.\n  07  REPO-GAIN-AMT-YTD     PIC S9(11)V99 COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-NO-MTD       PIC S9(9) COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-NO-YTD       PIC S9(9) COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-NO-LYR       PIC S9(9) COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-AMT-MTD      PIC S9(11)V99 COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-AMT-YTD      PIC S9(11)V99 COMP.\n  07  REPO-VOL-AMT-LYR      PIC S9(11)V9\n  ```\n  - These fields support detailed tracking and reporting of charge-off activity.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]], Lines 401-425)\n\n- **Processing Logic:**  \n  Programs like `[[FILE:BYRSUP.CBL|BYRSUP.CBL]]` aggregate charge-off counts and amounts for reporting:\n  ```cobol\n  * TOTAL NO OF PL CHARGE-OFFS MADE MTD & YTD\n  IF BY-CLASS NOT < 30 AND BY-CLASS NOT = 50       \n     ADD HOLD-MTD-PL TO TOT-WAGN-34\n  ELSE\n     MOVE HOLD-MTD-PL TO WR-NO-CHARGEOFFS(1)\n     MOVE HOLD-YTD-PL TO WR-NO-CHARGEOFFS(2)\n     ADD HOLD-MTD-PL TO TOT-WARS-34.\n  ```\n  - (Source: [[FILE:BYRSUP.CBL|BYRSUP.CBL]], Lines 1251-1275)\n\n### 3. **Loss Mitigation Tracking**\n\n- **Loss Mitigation Activities:**  \n  OTIS tracks loss mitigation through specialized fields and reporting routines, including:\n  - Bankruptcy buckets and recovery tracking\n  - Segregation of contractual vs. recency-based charge-offs\n  - Special handling for repossessions and settlements\n\n- **Business Rule Example:**  \n  From `[[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]]`, the system distinguishes between contractual and recency-based charge-offs:\n  ```cobol\n  * BUCKET 4 POT CHG-OFFS USE RECENCY NOT CONTRACTUAL FOR LNS\n  * IF GP-PROGRP-DL-CONY = \"Y\" THEN USE CONTRACTUAL INSTEAD OF RECENCY\n  IF GP-PROGRP-DL-CONT = \"Y\"\n     ADD BY-UNITS-BNKRPT(AGE-SUB,2,3)\n         BY-UNITS-BNKRPT(AGE-SUB,2,4)\n         ...\n     TO LOAN-BNKRPT-NO(TOT-SUB,AGE-SUB,3).\n  ```\n  - (Source: [[FILE:PROGRP.CBL|PROGRP.CBL]], Lines 2676-2700, 2626-2650)\n\n### 4. **Reporting and Audit**\n\n- **Reporting Programs:**  \n  OTIS includes programs and copybooks for generating charge-off and loss reports, such as:\n  - `[[FILE:SPWRGS_SQL.CPY|SPWRGS_SQL.CPY]]` for moving charge-off data into reporting structures\n  - `[[FILE:OPREP2.CBL|OPREP2.CBL]]` for volume and delinquency reporting\n  - `[[FILE:UP1534.CBL|UP1534.CBL]]` for charge-off expense tracking\n\n- **Sample Reporting Logic:**\n  ```cobol\n  MOVE WR-WCBC-CHARGEOFF-EXPENSE(1)\n   TO QWR-WCBC-CHARGEOFF-EXPENSE-1.\n  MOVE WR-WCBC-BAD-DEBT-BNKRPCY(1)\n   TO QWR-WCBC-BAD-DEBT-BNKRPCY-1.\n  ```\n  - (Source: [[FILE:SPWRGS_SQL.CPY|SPWRGS_SQL.CPY]], Lines 401-425)\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY FLOW\n\n**Typical Charge-off/Write-off Workflow in OTIS:**\n1. **Loan Evaluation:**  \n   - Programs scan loan records for charge-off criteria (delinquency, bankruptcy, etc.)\n2. **Eligibility Check:**  \n   - Date and status checks ensure only qualifying loans are processed\n3. **Amount Calculation:**  \n   - Charge-off/write-off amounts are computed and posted to appropriate fields\n4. **Loss Mitigation:**  \n   - Special handling for recoveries, settlements, and bankruptcy\n5. **Reporting:**  \n   - Aggregated data is moved to reporting structures for management and regulatory use\n\n---\n\n## VISUAL REPRESENTATION\n\nHere's a visual representation of the charge-off/write-off/loss mitigation process in OTIS:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"420\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Charge-off & Loss Mitigation Flow</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 1: Loan Evaluation -->\n  <rect x=\"60\" y=\"70\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"160\" y=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Loan Evaluation</text>\n  <text x=\"160\" y=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Delinquency, Bankruptcy, Status</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 2: Eligibility Check -->\n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"70\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#4ade80\" stroke=\"#16a34a\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"420\" y=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Eligibility Check</text>\n  <text x=\"420\" y=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Date/Status Rules</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 3: Amount Calculation -->\n  <rect x=\"580\" y=\"70\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"680\" y=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Amount Calculation</text>\n  <text x=\"680\" y=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Charge-off/Write-off</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 4: Loss Mitigation -->\n  <rect x=\"190\" y=\"200\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"290\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#15803d\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Loss Mitigation</text>\n  <text x=\"290\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#15803d\" font-size=\"12\">Recovery, Settlement</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 5: Reporting -->\n  <rect x=\"510\" y=\"200\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"610\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#1e40af\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Reporting</text>\n  <text x=\"610\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#1e40af\" font-size=\"12\">Management, Regulatory</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"260\" y1=\"105\" x2=\"320\" y2=\"105\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"520\" y1=\"105\" x2=\"580\" y2=\"105\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"680\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"610\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"420\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"290\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"290\" y1=\"270\" x2=\"610\" y2=\"270\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n## KEY PROGRAMS AND FILES\n\n- **Charge-off/Write-off Processing:**  \n  -

    "question": "How does OTIS manage automated clearing house (ACH) and electronic payment processing?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages Automated Clearing House (ACH) and electronic payment processing through a coordinated set of COBOL programs, copybooks, and business logic that automate the creation, validation, transmission, and reconciliation of ACH transactions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how OTIS handles these functions:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Automated Payment Collection:** OTIS enables lenders to collect loan payments electronically via ACH, reducing manual processing and improving efficiency.\n- **Deposit Transmission:** The system creates ACH deposit files for daily transmission to banks and payment processors.\n- **Validation & Compliance:** Ensures payments are properly authorized, formatted, and compliant with banking regulations.\n- **Exception Handling:** Manages errors, duplicate payments, and non-sufficient funds (NSF) scenarios.\n- **Audit & Reporting:** Tracks all ACH transactions for audit, reporting, and reconciliation.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### 1. **ACH File Creation and Transmission**\n\n- **ACHCRE Program:**  \n  - Creates the ACH deposit file (`/USR/DATA/R1/SP/ACFILE`) for transmission.\n  - Handles formatting of deposit information in ACH format.\n  - Includes logic for custom fields and transmission requirements for different institutions (e.g., Carolina First, Regency Finance).\n  - Manages file naming, FTP transmission, and remote copy logic.\n  - Source: [[FILE:ACHCRE.CBL|ACHCRE.CBL]], lines 1-25, 101-125\n\n- **ACHCRE_WKS, ACHCRE_DEF, ACHCRE_EVA:**  \n  - Support programs for work file management, default values, and evaluation logic.\n  - Source: [[FILE:P|P]]rograms ACHCRE_WKS, ACHCRE_DEF, ACHCRE_EVA\n\n- **Copybooks Used:**  \n  - **[[FILE:SP01AC.CPY|SP01AC.CPY]]:** Defines the ACH deposit (daily) file structure.\n    - \"ACH DEPOSIT (DAILY) FILE\" – key fields for payment amount, account, settlement date.\n    - Source: [[FILE:SP01AC.CPY|SP01AC.CPY]], lines 1-25\n  - **[[FILE:ACHCRE_SCN.CPY|ACHCRE_SCN.CPY]]:** Screen definitions for ACH creation.\n  - **[[FILE:CONAME_EXT.CPY|CONAME_EXT.CPY]]:** Extended company name fields for ACH records.\n  - **[[FILE:GRWORKW.CPY|GRWORKW.CPY]]:** Work file structures for ACH processing.\n\n### 2. **ACH Record Management and Clearing**\n\n- **UPACHCL Program:**  \n  - Manages clearing of ACH files and resets ACH record fields.\n  - Entry paragraphs: ACH-NEW-CHAR, CLEAR-ACH-FILE.\n  - Source: [[FILE:UPACHCL|UPACHCL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows\n\n- **UPACHI Program:**  \n  - Handles writing, rewriting, and closing of ACH files.\n  - Entry paragraphs: CLOSE-ACH-DONE-FILE, WRITE-ACH-FILE, REWRITE-ACH-FILE.\n  - Source: [[FILE:UPACHI|UPACHI]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows\n\n- **[[FILE:UPACHCL.CPY|UPACHCL.CPY]]:**  \n  - Contains logic to clear ACH record fields before new processing.\n  - Source: [[FILE:UPACHCL.CPY|UPACHCL.CPY]], lines 1-11\n\n- **[[FILE:UP01ACH.CPY|UP01ACH.CPY]]:**  \n  - Defines detailed ACH record fields (account, SSN, type, rates, allotment codes).\n  - Source: [[FILE:UP01ACH.CPY|UP01ACH.CPY]], lines 26-50, 51-75, 101-109\n\n### 3. **Electronic Payment Work Files**\n\n- **[[FILE:SPFDEP.CPY|SPFDEP.CPY]]:**  \n  - Defines the loan electronic payment file (OEP-FILE), keying on account number.\n  - Source: [[FILE:SPFDEP.CPY|SPFDEP.CPY]], lines 1-8\n\n- **[[FILE:SPFDEW.CPY|SPFDEW.CPY]]:**  \n  - Defines the loan electronic payment work file (OEW-FILE), used for staging payments before final ACH transmission.\n  - Source: [[FILE:SPFDEW.CPY|SPFDEW.CPY]], lines 1-8\n\n### 4. **Validation, Exception Handling, and Reconciliation**\n\n- **Bank Clearing and NSF Checks:**  \n  - Programs and copybooks (e.g., [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]], [[FILE:MBEOD5TR.CPY|MBEOD5TR.CPY]]) perform bank clearing logic, update work files, and check for NSF conditions.\n  - Example logic:\n    ```cobol\n    PERFORM BANK-CLEARING-CHECKS-NSF\n    PERFORM UPDATE-WORK-FILE-TRC\n    ```\n    - Source: [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]], lines 3201-3225; [[FILE:MBEOD5TR.CPY|MBEOD5TR.CPY]], lines 3126-3150\n\n- **Error Handling:**  \n  - Duplicate payments, invalid routing/account numbers, and other exceptions are managed and logged.\n  - Example: \"ROUTING NO.

    "question": "What general ledger integration and accounting functions does OTIS provide?",
    "answer": "OTIS provides a robust set of general ledger (GL) integration and accounting functions to support financial tracking, reporting, and compliance for loan servicing and related financial operations. Here’s a summary of the key GL integration and accounting capabilities in OTIS, based on the COBOL source and copybook definitions:\n\n---\n\n### BUSINESS PURPOSE\n\n**OTIS General Ledger Integration and Accounting Functions:**\n\n- **Automated Posting of Financial Transactions:**  \n  OTIS automatically generates and posts GL entries for all significant financial events, including loan payments, charge-offs, write-offs, refunds, and ACH/electronic transactions.\n\n- **GL Inquiry and Reporting:**  \n  Users can inquire on GL transactions, balances, and account histories through dedicated inquiry programs and screens (e.g., GLINQ for transaction inquiry).\n\n- **GL Account Maintenance:**  \n  The system provides menu-driven maintenance for GL accounts, including adding, updating, and deleting accounts (e.g., GLMNMU - GL Maintenance Menu, GIMAN5 - GL Controls Maintenance).\n\n- **Distribution and Allocation:**  \n  OTIS supports detailed GL distribution records for loan payments and other transactions, ensuring amounts are allocated to the correct accounts (see [[FILE:LP01LXG.CPY|LP01LXG.CPY]] for GL distribution record structure).\n\n- **Journal Entry Management:**  \n  Journal detail lines are managed and stored for audit and reconciliation (see [[FILE:GL01JD.CPY|GL01JD.CPY]] for journal detail structure).\n\n- **Batch and Real-Time Processing:**  \n  Both batch and online (real-time) posting of GL entries are supported, allowing for end-of-day processing as well as immediate updates.\n\n- **Investor and Branch Accounting:**  \n  The system tracks GL activity by branch, account, and investor, supporting multi-entity accounting and remittance.\n\n---\n\n### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**Key Programs and Copybooks:**\n\n- **GL Transaction Inquiry:**  \n  -

charge-off), OTIS generates GL distribution records ([[FILE:LP01LXG.CPY|LP01LXG.CPY]]) and posts them to the GL transaction file ([[FILE:GL01GT.CPY|GL01GT.CPY]]).\n\n- **Journal Entry Creation:**  \n  Detailed journal entries are created and stored ([[FILE:GL01JD.CPY|GL01JD.CPY]]), supporting audit trails and reconciliation.\n\n- **GL Master Update:**  \n  The GL master file ([[FILE:GLFDGL.CPY|GLFDGL.CPY]]) is updated to reflect new balances and activity.\n\n- **Inquiry and Reporting:**  \n  Users and batch processes can access transaction and balance data for reporting, reconciliation, and compliance.\n\n---\n\n### ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM\n\nHere's a visual representation of the OTIS general ledger integration and accounting architecture:\n\n<svg width=\"700\"

    "question_number": 19,
    "question": "How does OTIS handle multi-currency or international loan servicing if applicable?",
    "answer": "OTIS provides limited but targeted support for multi-currency and international loan servicing, primarily through specialized data structures, calculation routines, and business logic designed to accommodate loans outside the standard domestic context.\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Support for international loans (e.g., Mexico, Canada, cross-border lending) is implemented to handle:\n  - Currency conversion for principal, interest, and fees\n  - Country-specific calculation formulas (e.g., maintenance fees, service charges)\n  - Regulatory compliance for non-US jurisdictions\n  - Reporting and accounting for loans denominated in foreign currencies\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Special Calculation Logic for International Loans:**\n   - Programs such as CALCZL and SPMAN3 include logic for Mexico-specific maintenance fee formulas and other international rules.\n     - Example: \"SP-ROUNF-MFEE. THIS WILL FORCE CALCZL TO ROUND UP THE MAINTFEE FOR MEXICO MFFRMLA 05 LOANS...\" (Source: [[FILE:SPMAN3.CBL|SPMAN3.CBL]], Lines 76-100)\n     - \"ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 17 AND 60/61 IS THE RATE\" (Source: [[FILE:CALCZL.CBL|CALCZL.CBL]], Lines 4926-4950)\n   - These routines use country codes and formula switches (e.g., SP-SCFRMLA) to apply different interest rates, service charges, and rounding rules for international loans.\n\n2. **Data Structures for International Information:**\n   - Copybooks such as [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]] contain fields for reporting secondary marketing agency interest and mortgage info, which may be relevant for international or cross-border loans.\n     - Example: \"TO INDICATE A SECONDARY MARKETING AGENCY'S INTEREST IN A LOAN OR TO REPORT THE MORTGAGE...\" (Source: [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]], Lines 726-750)\n\n3. **Currency Handling:**\n   - While explicit multi-currency fields (e.g., currency codes, exchange rates) are not directly shown in the retrieved context, the presence of country-specific formulas and logic implies that currency conversion and handling are managed within calculation routines and reporting modules.\n\n4. **Regulatory and Compliance Logic:**\n   - Comments and code indicate special handling for international regulatory requirements, such as fee calculation restrictions and reporting formats.\n   - Example: \"SHALL NEVER BE IMPOSED ON ANY PORTION OF ANY LOAN USED TO PAY ANY EXISTING LOAN OWING BY THE SAME BORROWER\" (Source: [[FILE:CALCZL.CBL|CALCZL.CBL]], Lines 4926-4950)\n\n5. **Reporting and Accounting:**\n   - International loans are included in reporting modules, with logic to ensure correct accounting for foreign-denominated balances and transactions.\n\n**SUMMARY OF KEY COMPONENTS:**\n\n| Program/Copybook         | Purpose/Role in International Servicing                                 |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [[FILE:CALCZL.CBL|CALCZL.CBL]]               | Calculation logic for international loan formulas, rates, fees          |\n| [[FILE:SPMAN3.CBL|SPMAN3.CBL]]               | Maintenance fee rounding and formula selection for Mexico loans          |\n| [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]]           | Data structures for international mortgage/secondary market reporting    |\n| Various formula switches | Country-specific logic (e.g., SP-SCFRMLA, SP-ROUNF-MFEE)                |\n\n**LIMITATIONS:**\n- The retrieved context does not show a comprehensive multi-currency engine (e.g., dynamic currency code fields, exchange rate tables).\n- International support appears to be implemented via conditional logic and specialized formulas rather than a full-featured multi-currency subsystem.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nOTIS handles international loan servicing by embedding country-specific calculation logic, reporting structures, and compliance routines within its COBOL programs and copybooks. This enables support for select international markets (notably Mexico), but does not provide a generalized multi-currency platform.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [[FILE:SPMAN3.CBL|SPMAN3.CBL]], Lines 76-100 (maintenance fee logic for Mexico)\n- [[FILE:CALCZL.CBL|CALCZL.CBL]], Lines 4926-4950 (rate/service charge differences for international loans)\n- [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]], Lines 726-750 (international mortgage reporting fields)\n\n---\n\nHere's a visual representation of how international loan servicing logic is integrated within OTIS:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"420\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS International Loan Servicing Architecture</text>\n  \n  <!-- Main Calculation Programs -->\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">CALCZL</text>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">International Loan Calculations</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">SPMAN3</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Mexico Fee Logic</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"600\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Reporting Modules</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">International Reporting</text>\n  \n  <!-- Copybook for Data Structures -->\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"200\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#4ade80\" stroke=\"#16a34a\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">[[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]]</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">International Mortgage Data</text>\n  \n  <!-- Formula Switches -->\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"320\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"350\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">SP-SCFRMLA</text>\n  <text x=\"200\" y=\"370\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Country-Specific Formula Switch</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"600\" y=\"320\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"350\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">SP-ROUNF-MFEE</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"370\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"12\">Mexico Maintenance Fee Rounding</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"200\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"700\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"270\" x2=\"200\" y2=\"320\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"270\" x2=\"700\" y2=\"320\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>",

    "question_number": 20,
    "question": "What financial analytics and portfolio management capabilities exist in OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS provides a comprehensive set of financial analytics and portfolio management capabilities to support loan servicing, asset tracking, and business decision-making. These capabilities are implemented through a combination of COBOL programs, copybooks, and business logic modules that automate calculations, reporting, and portfolio aggregation.\n\n**Financial Analytics Capabilities:**\n\n- **Portfolio Totals & Aggregation:**\n  - OTIS tracks and aggregates portfolio totals for different business lines (e.g., sales finance, direct lending).\n  - Example: The `PORTFOLIO-TOTALS` structure in [[FILE:CPCORP.CBL|CPCORP.CBL]] accumulates amounts and counts for each portfolio type.\n    - `PORT-NO` (portfolio number)\n    - `PORT-AMT` (portfolio amount)\n    - `ACCUM-DL-NO`, `ACCUM-DL-AMT` (direct lending totals)\n    - `ACCUM-SF-NO`, `ACCUM-SF-AMT` (sales finance totals)\n  - (Source: [[FILE:CPCORP.CBL|CPCORP.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n- **Earnings & GL Analytics:**\n  - Programs such as MBALR3, EMOTRG, MBALR6H, and RZTRRG perform detailed analytics on earnings, interest, and general ledger (GL) accounts.\n  - They process fields like `QTP-EARNINGS-1` to `QTP-EARNINGS-5`, `QTP-GLNO-1` to `QTP-GLNO-3`, and related amounts for financial reporting.\n  - These analytics support monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting cycles.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:MBALR3.CBL|MBALR3.CBL]], [[FILE:EMOTRG.CBL|EMOTRG.CBL]], [[FILE:MBALR6H.CBL|MBALR6H.CBL]], [[FILE:RZTRRG.CBL|RZTRRG.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n- **Classification & Segmentation:**\n  - OTIS segments portfolios by business type, such as personal services, insurance, banking, rental, utilities, etc.\n  - Example: The `TRW-K1-CLASSIFICATION` field in [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]] enables classification for analytics and reporting.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **Loan-Level Analytics:**\n  - Programs like LPEARN and LPAVCR compute earnings and available credit at the individual loan level.\n  - These calculations feed into broader portfolio analytics and risk assessment.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:LPEARN|LPEARN]], [[FILE:LPAVCR|LPAVCR]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n- **General Ledger Integration:**\n  - OTIS integrates with GL systems to track financial transactions, earnings, and balances.\n  - GL account numbers and amounts are processed for reconciliation and compliance.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:MBALR3.CBL|MBALR3.CBL]], [[FILE:EMOTRG.CBL|EMOTRG.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n**Portfolio Management Capabilities:**\n\n- **Purchased/Sold Portfolio Tracking:**\n  - OTIS tracks portfolios purchased from or sold to other companies, supporting M&A and asset transfer analytics.\n  - Example: The TRW K2 segment in [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]] records the name of the company involved in portfolio transactions.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:SPFDMETRO2.CPY|SPFDMETRO2.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **Multi-Portfolio Support:**\n  - Structures like `PORTFOLIO-TOTALS OCCURS 2 TIMES` allow OTIS to manage multiple portfolios simultaneously (e.g., direct lending vs. sales finance).\n  -

    "question_number": 22,
    "question": "How does OTIS handle the daily payment posting and application process?",
    "answer": "OTIS handles the daily payment posting and application process through a coordinated workflow involving several specialized COBOL programs, copybooks, and business logic modules. The process ensures payments are validated, applied to loan accounts, and all relevant balances and histories are updated accurately.\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Accepts daily payment batches from various sources (lockbox, teller, online, etc.)\n- Validates each payment against account status, loan rules, and business constraints\n- Applies payments to principal, interest, late charges, escrow, and other balances according to contract terms and regulatory requirements\n- Updates loan records, payment histories, and generates exception logs for errors or unusual conditions\n- Supports batch and manual posting, including special handling for bankruptcies, reversals, payoffs, and deferred payments\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n### 1. **Batch Payment Intake**\n- Payments are collected into work files (e.g., WK-FILE) for batch processing.\n- Programs like **LONPF9** and **DAILY** initiate the batch payment routine.\n\n### 2. **Validation and Routing**\n- Each payment is validated for:\n  - Account status (active, bankrupt, repo, etc.)\n  - Payment amount and type (regular, payoff, reversal, etc.)\n  - Compliance with business rules (e.g., cannot post more than one transaction for interbranch posting, see [[FILE:LONPF0.CBL|LONPF0.CBL]])\n- Conditional logic determines the posting path:\n  - **Bankruptcy**: Special routines (BANKRUPT-POSTING)\n  - **Reversal**: REVERSAL-POSTING\n  - **Payoff**: PAYOFF-POSTING\n  - **Regular Payment**: PAYMENT-POSTING\n\n  (Source: [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], lines 1726-1750)\n\n### 3. **Application of Payment**\n- Payments are applied to balances in a specific order:\n  - Principal\n  - Interest\n  - Late charges\n  - Escrow (if applicable)\n- Calculations ensure correct allocation, including handling for deferred payments and prepayments.\n- Example logic:\n  ```cobol\n  IF DF-POSTING\n     ADD DEF-NODEF TO LN-TOTNODEF\n     ADD DEF-NODEFACT TO LN-TOTNODEFACT.\n  PERFORM SETUP-PRIN-PAYMNTD.\n  PERFORM SETUP-PDTH-LPREC.\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:LONPFC.CBL|LONPFC.CBL]], lines 1226-1250)\n\n### 4. **Exception Handling**\n- If a payment cannot be applied (e.g., due to account status or validation failure), error codes and messages are generated.\n- Exception routines log issues and may trigger notifications or require manual review.\n- Example:\n  ```cobol\n  IF ERRCD = \"E\" OR \"X\" OR \"M\"\n     MOVE \"LONPF2: PMT NOT APPLIED  \" TO LOG-MSG\n     MOVE 69 TO RETURN-STA\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:APIPAY.CBL|APIPAY.CBL]], lines 1476-1500)\n\n### 5. **Updating Records**\n- Successful payments update loan records, payment histories, and related files.\n- Copybooks such as **[[FILE:DAILY_WKS.CPY|DAILY_WKS.CPY]]**, **[[FILE:LPAPRZ.CPY|LPAPRZ.CPY]]**, **[[FILE:REBATE.CPY|REBATE.CPY]]**, and others define the data structures for these updates.\n- Batch routines ensure all changes are committed and files are synchronized.\n\n### 6. **Reporting and Audit**\n- End-of-day routines generate reports on posted payments, exceptions, and account statuses.\n- Audit logs are maintained for compliance and reconciliation.\n\n---\n\n**KEY PROGRAMS INVOLVED:**\n- **DAILY**: Orchestrates daily batch processing, uses many copybooks for loan/payment data.\n- **LONPF9**: Handles batch payment routines, selection, and application logic.\n- **LONPFC**: Manages payment allocation, contractual calculations, and exception handling.\n- **APIPAY**: Handles payment validation and posting, including error logging.\n- **LONPW9**: Manages posting logic for bankruptcies, reversals, payoffs, and regular payments.\n\n**KEY COPYBOOKS USED (examples):**\n- **[[FILE:DAILY_WKS.CPY|DAILY_WKS.CPY]]** – Daily processing working storage\n- **[[FILE:LPAPRZ.CPY|LPAPRZ.CPY]]** – Loan payment and amortization structures\n- **[[FILE:REBATE.CPY|REBATE.CPY]]** – Rebate calculations and structures\n- **[[FILE:LPPDUE.CPY|LPPDUE.CPY]]** – Payment due tracking\n- **[[FILE:LPAMTSW.CPY|LPAMTSW.CPY]]** – Loan amounts working storage\n\n---\n\n**WORKFLOW SUMMARY:**\n1.

    "question": "What batch processing cycles does OTIS run (daily, monthly, year-end)?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) runs several key batch processing cycles to support loan servicing and financial operations. These cycles are scheduled and executed to ensure accurate posting, updating, and reporting of financial data across the system. The main batch cycles are:\n\n---\n\n**1. Daily Batch Processing**\n- **Purpose:** Handles daily payment posting, delinquency updates, contractual status changes, and other routine loan servicing tasks.\n- **Key Activities:**\n  - Posts payments received during the day\n  - Updates loan statuses (e.g., delinquency, paid, outstanding)\n  - Applies contractual changes and recalculates balances\n  - Prepares data for daily reporting and reconciliation\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - The DAILY program is central to this process.\n  - It uses numerous copybooks for loan, payment, and date handling (e.g., [[FILE:LP01DS_SQL.CPY|LP01DS_SQL.CPY]], [[FILE:DAILY_WKS.CPY|DAILY_WKS.CPY]], [[FILE:LPCEPPW.CPY|LPCEPPW.CPY]]).\n  - Contains logic to skip processing on the last day of the month to avoid conflicts with monthly cycles.\n  - Entry paragraphs include FORM-RESET, SETUP-LINK-INFO, STOP-RUN.\n  - Example code:\n    ```cobol\n    PERFORM ARRAYSP-LOAD.\n    MOVE TODAY-IS-DATE TO NUM-DATE.\n    PERFORM FIND-FISCAL-PERIOD.\n    IF SUB NOT = 0\n       IF TODAY-IS-DATE = GP-END-FISCAL-DATE(SUB)\n          GO TO END-PROGRAM.\n    PERFORM CLEAR-BYFILE.\n    PERFORM UPDATE-BY-DS-STATS.\n    GO TO END-PROGRAM.\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:DAILY.CBL|DAILY.CBL]], Lines 276-300)\n\n---\n\n**2. Monthly Batch Processing**\n- **Purpose:** Performs end-of-month accruals, earnings calculations, and updates for all loans and accounts.\n- **Key Activities:**\n  - Calculates monthly interest accruals and earnings\n  - Updates branch and group-level financial statistics\n  - Generates monthly reports for management and compliance\n  - May include special handling for non-accrual loans and reporting fields\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - Programs such as AC1ERN, RZRERN, and others handle monthly accrual and reporting.\n  - Logic includes looping through branches/groups and updating reporting fields.\n  - Example comment:\n    ```\n    * UPDATE-BY-LAST WHEN EACH BRANCH'S PROCESSING IS COMPLETE,\n    * SUPPORT PL# 672\n    * ... CALL RAC323 WHICH LOOPS THRU EACH BRANCH IN THE GROUP RANGE,\n    * AND UPDATES THE LRFILE & AEFILE NON-ACCRUAL INTERNAL REPORTING FIELDS\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:RZRERN.CBL|RZRERN.CBL]], Lines 101-125)\n\n---\n\n**3. Year-End (EOY) Batch Processing**\n- **Purpose:** Performs fiscal year-end updates, statistics roll-up, and prepares data for regulatory and financial reporting.\n- **Key Activities:**\n  - Runs fiscal year-end routines to update statistics and close out the year\n  - Moves EOY flags and resets for the new fiscal year\n  - Generates year-end reports and extracts required for compliance\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - UPDEOY program manages year-end logic, including running EOY routines and moving flags.\n  - EOCRON allows batch execution via cron/shell for automated scheduling.\n  - Example comment:\n    ```\n    * 2) RUN END-OF-MONTH\n    * 3) RUN FISCAL END-OF-YEAR (TO DO JUST STATS)\n    * 4) MOVE THE EOY FLAG BACK SO THEY WILL PASS OPEN DAY CHECK (MV EOY02F EOY02B)\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:UPDEOY.CBL|UPDEOY.CBL]], Lines 26-50)\n  - EOCRON is used for batch automation:\n    ```\n    * DESC:  EXECUTE BATCH FROM CRON\n    * NOTE: IF IT RUNS IN BATCH, IT CAN BE RUN THROUGH EOCRON.\n    *       EOCRON DOES THE SAME STUFF AS EOEXEC, BUT INSTEAD OF\n    *       SCREEN INPUT, IT GETS THE STEPS & DATE OFFSETS FROM A SHELL.\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:EOCRON.CBL|EOCRON.CBL]], Lines 1-25)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Batch Cycles in OTIS**\n\n| Cycle    | Main Program(s) | Key Activities                                 | Scheduling/Automation      |\n|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Daily    | DAILY           | Payment posting, status updates, stats         | Scheduled daily           |\n| Monthly  | AC1ERN, RZRERN  | Accruals, earnings, reporting                  | End-of-month              |\n| Year-End | UPDEOY, EOCRON  | Fiscal close, stats roll-up, compliance        | Fiscal year-end, cron     |\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Batch Processing Cycles</text>\n  \n  <!-- Daily -->\n  <rect x=\"60\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"170\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Daily Cycle</text>\n  <text x=\"170\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"13\" fill=\"#6366f1\">DAILY</text>\n  <text x=\"170\" y=\"150\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#6366f1\">Payments, Status Updates</text>\n  \n  <!-- Monthly -->\n  <rect x=\"340\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Monthly Cycle</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"13\" fill=\"#1e40af\">AC1ERN, RZRERN</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"150\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3b82f6\">Accruals, Earnings, Reports</text>\n  \n  <!-- Year-End -->\n  <rect x=\"620\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"10\"/>\n  <text x=\"730\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Year-End Cycle</text>\n  <text x=\"730\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"13\" fill=\"#15803d\">UPDEOY, EOCRON</text>\n  <text x=\"730\" y=\"150\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">Fiscal Close, Compliance</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrow\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#666\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"280\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"340\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"560\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"620\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n**Source Citations:**\n- DAILY batch logic and skip-on-month-end: (Source: [[FILE:DAILY.CBL|DAILY.CBL]], Lines 276-300)\n- DAILY program description: (Source: [[FILE:DAILY.CBL|DAILY.CBL]], Lines 1-25)\n- Monthly accrual/update logic: (Source: [[FILE:RZRERN.CBL|RZRERN.CBL]], Lines 101-125)\n- Year-end batch steps and flag handling: (Source: [[FILE:UPDEOY.CBL|UPDEOY.CBL]], Lines 26-50)\n- EOCRON batch automation: (Source: [[FILE:EOCRON.CBL|EOCRON.CBL]], Lines 1-25)\n\nIf you need details on the specific programs or copybooks involved in each cycle, let me know!",

    "question": "How does OTIS manage customer statement generation and delivery?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages customer statement generation and delivery through a coordinated process involving specialized COBOL programs, configurable form options, and integration with external delivery systems. The workflow ensures statements are produced in the correct format for each customer and delivered via the appropriate channel.\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Generate periodic statements summarizing loan activity, balances, and payments for each customer.\n- Support multiple output formats (standard, laser, PCL, SmartPort) to meet customer and regulatory requirements.\n- Deliver statements via print, electronic, or third-party systems (e.g., SmartPort for BF Motor Credit).\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Statement Generation Programs:**\n   - The main program for statement generation is **STATEMENT**.\n     - STATEMENT is called by other programs to initiate statement creation (Source: [[FILE:STATEMEN|STATEMEN]]T, Index: programs).\n     - It does not call other programs directly, indicating it is a terminal process in the call chain.\n\n2. **Form Type Configuration:**\n   - The form type for each statement is controlled by the **FD-OPTION** field, defined in the [[FILE:LP01FD.CPY|LP01FD.CPY]] copybook.\n   - Supported options:\n     - `\"N\"` = Standard Form (LONP or PRT)\n     - `\"P\"` = PCL/Laser Form (PARADATA)\n     - `\"T\"` = PST/Laser Form (PARADATA)\n     - `\"Y\"` = SmartPort (external package for BF Motor Credit)\n     - `\"C\"` = Customer Statement (CUSTMT)\n     - `\"E\"` = Extraction (Corporate)\n   - The FD-OPTION is validated against allowed values (Source: [[FILE:LP01FD.CPY|LP01FD.CPY]], Index: code).\n\n3. **SmartPort Integration:**\n   - For customers using SmartPort, a trigger is placed on line 1 of the document.\n   - SmartPort then handles field mapping and delivery (Source: [[FILE:LP01FD.CPY|LP01FD.CPY]], Index: code).\n   - This allows OTIS to outsource delivery and formatting for specific clients.\n\n4. **Statement Content Assembly:**\n   - Statement programs (e.g., STATEMENT, PST608, PST609, PST610) assemble statement data by reading loan records, payment history, and account balances.\n   - Data fields such as balances, interest, charges, and payment details are moved into statement layouts (see code examples in [[FILE:LNEXTR.CBL|LNEXTR.CBL]], [[FILE:PLPURG.CBL|PLPURG.CBL]], etc.).\n\n5. **Delivery Mechanisms:**\n   - Statements are printed or electronically delivered based on the FD-OPTION.\n   - For print, statements are formatted according to the selected form type and sent to the appropriate printer or output queue.\n   - For electronic delivery, integration points (e.g., SmartPort) handle transmission to customers.\n\n---\n\n**PROCESS FLOW SUMMARY:**\n\n1. **Trigger:** Statement generation is initiated (scheduled batch or on-demand).\n2. **Form Selection:** FD-OPTION determines the output format and delivery channel.\n3. **Data Assembly:** Statement programs gather and format customer data.\n4. **Output:** Statements are printed, sent electronically, or handed off to SmartPort.\n5. **Delivery:** Customers receive statements via mail, electronic systems, or third-party providers.\n\n---\n\n**CODE EXAMPLES & SOURCES:**\n\n- **Form Type Configuration:**\n  ```cobol\n  *    \"C\" = CUSTOMER STATEMENT {CUSTMT}\n  *    \"E\" = EXTRACTION (CORPORATE)\n  *    \"N\" = STANDARD  FORM {LONP OR PRT}\n  *    \"P\" = PCL/LASER FORM {PCL} (PARADATA)\n  *    \"T\" = PST/LASER FORM {PST} (PARADATA)\n  *    \"Y\" = SMARTPORT\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:LP01FD.CPY|LP01FD.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **SmartPort Integration:**\n  ```cobol\n  * SMARTPORT IS AN OUTSIDE PACKAGE USED BY BF MOTOR CREDIT THAT\n  * NEEDS A TRIGGER ON LINE 1 OF OUR DOCUMENTS, THEN THEY DO ALL\n  * THE MOVING OF FIELDS TO THE CORRECT POSITIONS.\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:LP01FD.CPY|LP01FD.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n- **Main Statement Program:**\n  - STATEMENT (no outgoing calls;

    "question": "What are the key month-end and year-end closing processes in OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) manages month-end and year-end closing through a series of coordinated COBOL programs and business rules designed to ensure financial integrity, compliance, and accurate reporting for loan servicing and related operations.\n\n---\n\n**KEY MONTH-END CLOSING PROCESSES**\n\n**Business Purpose:**\n- Finalize all transactions for the month\n- Update balances, clear temporary fields, and prepare for the next month\n- Generate regulatory and management reports\n- Ensure all required monthly activities (e.g., payment posting, adjustments) are complete before closing\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- **End-of-Month (EOM) Programs:**  \n  - **ENDMTH**: Handles G/L end-of-month processing, including purging old transactions and updating tag files for documentation (Source: [[FILE:ENDMTH.CBL|ENDMTH.CBL]], Index: code).\n  - **EOMALL**: Creates new month records, clears monthly-to-date (MTD) figures, and resets P&L collected fields (Source: [[FILE:EOMALL.CBL|EOMALL.CBL]], Lines 1326-1350).\n  - **Validation Logic:**  \n    - Programs check that all required monthly processes are complete before allowing EOM to run.\n    - Example: \"TEST PRIOR EOM COMPLETE & CALENDAR EOY COMPLETE & DON'T ALLOW OPENING DAY IN NEW MONTH UNLESS DONE\" (Source: [[FILE:LONPA0.CBL|LONPA0.CBL]], Lines 26-50).\n  - **Reporting:**  \n    - Generates month-end reports for management and compliance.\n\n---\n\n**KEY YEAR-END CLOSING PROCESSES**\n\n**Business Purpose:**\n- Finalize annual financial records\n- Perform regulatory/statistical reporting\n- Reset annual accumulators and prepare for the new fiscal year\n- Prevent errors from running year-end before month-end or in incorrect combinations\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- **End-of-Year (EOY) Programs:**  \n  - **UPDEOY**: Main EOY clearing and update program.  \n    - Verifies that EOM has been completed before EOY can run.\n    - Handles EOY flags, error logging, and group logic for branches (Source: [[FILE:UPDEOY.CBL|UPDEOY.CBL]], Lines 1-75).\n    - Attempts to \"fool-proof\" the EOY procedure to avoid common mistakes (e.g., running EOY before EOM, running incorrect year-end types) (Source: [[FILE:UPDEOY.CBL|UPDEOY.CBL]], Lines 51-75).\n  - **ENDYER**: Manages year-end screens and user prompts for EOY processing (Source: [[FILE:ENDYER.CBL|ENDYER.CBL]], Lines 326-350).\n  - **EOYUPD**: Updates year-end records, uses SQL copybooks for reporting and data updates (Source: [[FILE:EOYUPD.CBL|EOYUPD.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage).\n  - **GLTAGS**: Logs GL/EOY activity and replaces tag files for documentation (Source: [[FILE:GLTAGS.CBL|GLTAGS.CBL]], Lines 1-25).\n- **Validation Logic:**  \n  -

    "question": "How does OTIS support audit trails and compliance reporting requirements?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) supports audit trails and compliance reporting through a combination of dedicated COBOL programs, structured file management, and integration with regulatory reporting processes. Here’s how the system achieves these goals:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Audit Trails:**  \n  OTIS maintains detailed records of all financial transactions, user actions, and system events. This ensures traceability for internal controls, regulatory audits, and operational reviews.\n- **Compliance Reporting:**  \n  The system generates periodic reports (daily, monthly, year-end) required by regulators and internal policy, including transaction logs, aging reports, and exception summaries.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n1. **Dedicated Audit Programs**\n   - Programs such as **AUDITW**, **AUDEXT**, **AUDEXT-MB**, and **MBDEXT** are responsible for writing, updating, and extracting audit records.\n   - These programs process transaction logs, update audit files, and prepare data for compliance reports.\n     - Example:  \n       - **AUDITW** manages audit file updates and extracts, with entry paragraphs like `UPDATE-AUDIT-PEFILE`, `SET-SNFILE`, and `UPDATE-AUDIT-PEFILE` (Source: [[FILE:AUDITW|AUDITW]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n       - **AUDEXT-MB** and **MBDEXT** handle extraction and categorization of audit data for reporting (Source: [[FILE:AUDEXT-M|AUDEXT-M]]B, MBDEXT, Index: flows).\n\n2. **Structured File Management**\n   - Audit programs use specialized copybooks to define audit file layouts and working storage:\n     - **[[FILE:GBWSGR.CPY|GBWSGR.CPY]]** – Audit working storage definitions\n     - **[[FILE:GB01GR_SQL.CPY|GB01GR_SQL.CPY]]** – SQL audit record structures\n     - **[[FILE:GBFSWKI.CPY|GBFSWKI.CPY]]** – File switch/key information for audit files\n     - **[[FILE:GBWKIN.CPY|GBWKIN.CPY]]** – Audit file input/output definitions\n     - **[[FILE:FERRORS.CPY|FERRORS.CPY]]** – Error handling for audit file operations\n     (Source: [[FILE:AUDEXT-MB.CBL|AUDEXT-MB.CBL]], [[FILE:MBDEXT.CBL|MBDEXT.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage)\n\n3. **Batch Cycle Integration**\n   - Audit trail updates and compliance reporting are integrated into daily, month-end, and year-end batch cycles.\n   - Programs like **EORUN** and **EOEXEC** coordinate batch processing, ensuring audit files are updated and reports are generated as part of closing routines (Source: [[FILE:EORUN|EORUN]], [[FILE:EOEXEC|EOEXEC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n4. **Regulatory and Internal Reporting**\n   - Programs such as **MBAGED**, **RZCORP**, **RZWRI1**, and **RZMTRL** generate aging reports, corporate compliance summaries, and write audit data to output files for review.\n   - These reports support both regulatory filings and internal management oversight (Source: [[FILE:MBAGED|MBAGED]], [[FILE:RZCORP|RZCORP]], [[FILE:RZWRI1|RZWRI1]], [[FILE:RZMTRL|RZMTRL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n5. **Error Handling and Data Integrity**\n   - Copybooks like **[[FILE:FERRORS.CPY|FERRORS.CPY]]** and **[[FILE:ACCESSW.CPY|ACCESSW.CPY]]** provide error logging and access control, ensuring audit records are complete and tamper-resistant (Source: [[FILE:AUDEXT-MB.CBL|AUDEXT-MB.CBL]], [[FILE:AUDITW.CBL|AUDITW.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage).\n\n---\n\n**EXAMPLE PROGRAM FLOW (AUDITW):**\n\n- Entry points such as `MAIN-PROGRAM`, `UPDATE-AUDIT-PEFILE`, and `SET-SNFILE` manage the creation and update of audit records.\n- No outgoing calls detected, indicating a focused role in audit file management (Source: [[FILE:AUDITW|AUDITW]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n---\n\n**DATA FLOW DIAGRAM**\n\nHere's a visual representation of how audit and compliance reporting is supported in OTIS:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Audit Trail & Compliance Reporting</text>\n  \n  <!-- Transaction Programs -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Transaction Programs</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#6366f1\">Loan Servicing, Payments</text>\n  \n  <!-- Audit Programs -->\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Audit Programs</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3b82f6\">AUDITW, AUDEXT, MBDEXT</text>\n  \n  <!-- Compliance Reporting -->\n  <rect x=\"650\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"750\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Compliance Reporting</text>\n  <text x=\"750\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">MBAGED, RZCORP, RZMTRL</text>\n  \n  <!-- Audit Files -->\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"250\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#fef9c3\" stroke=\"#f59e0b\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"280\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#b45309\">Audit Files</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"300\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#f59e0b\">Structured Records</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrow\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#666\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"250\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"350\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"550\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"650\" y2=\"120\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"750\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\n- OTIS uses specialized audit programs and copybooks to record, manage, and report all critical system activities.\n- Audit trails are updated during batch cycles and are accessible for compliance reporting.\n- Structured file management and error handling ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance.\n- Compliance reports are generated by dedicated programs and support both internal and external requirements.\n\n**Sources:**\n- AUDITW, AUDEXT, AUDEXT-MB, MBDEXT, MBAGED, RZCORP, RZMTRL (Index: flows, copybook_usage)\n- EORUN, EOEXEC (Index: flows)\n- Copybooks: [[FILE:GBWSGR.CPY|GBWSGR.CPY]], [[FILE:GB01GR_SQL.CPY|GB01GR_SQL.CPY]], [[FILE:GBFSWKI.CPY|GBFSWKI.CPY]], [[FILE:GBWKIN.CPY|GBWKIN.CPY]], [[FILE:FERRORS.CPY|FERRORS.CPY]], [[FILE:ACCESSW.CPY|ACCESSW.CPY]] (Index: copybook_usage)\n\nIf you need details on a specific audit or compliance report, or want to see the structure of an audit file, let me know!",

    "question": "What exception handling and research processes exist in OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) implements robust exception handling and research processes to ensure data integrity, compliance, and operational efficiency. These processes are distributed across multiple COBOL programs, each specializing in different types of exceptions and research workflows.\n\n---\n\n**EXCEPTION HANDLING IN OTIS**\n\n**1. Exception Detection and Logging**\n- Programs like **LONPW9**, **SETIMP**, **WDAYBK**, and **BULKG2** contain logic to detect business and processing exceptions.\n- Common exception scenarios include:\n  - Invalid posting codes or amounts\n  - Deceased or fraud account status\n  - Credit bureau status mismatches\n  - Repo and payoff anomalies\n  - Missing or invalid data fields\n\n**Example:**\n```cobol\nIF (POSTING-ERRCD NOT = \"O\") AND (HOLD-OVPAID-CHECK = 0)\n   ADD ORIG-BP-TRAMT TO AMOUNT-EXCEPTION(1)\n   ADD 1 TO TOTAL-EXCEPTION(1)\n   PERFORM EXCEPTION-LINE-PROCESS.\n   MOVE \"E\" TO BP-UPDFG.\n   PERFORM REWRITE-BP1-FILE.\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], Lines 2801-2825)\n\n**2. Exception Reporting and Totals**\n- Exceptions are accumulated in arrays (e.g., `AMOUNT-EXCEPTION`, `TOTAL-EXCEPTION`) and printed in summary sections.\n- Programs generate detailed and summary exception reports for audit and operational review.\n\n**Example:**\n```cobol\nIF TOTAL-EXCEPTION(LEV) NOT = 0\n   IF LEV = 1\n      MOVE \"TOTAL EXCEPTIONS BR# &&&&\" TO S-BRNAME\n      INSPECT S-BRNAME REPLACING FIRST \"&&&&\" BY BR-NO\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], Lines 3101-3125)\n\n**3. Specialized Exception Types**\n- Repo exceptions (repossession-related) are handled with dedicated logic:\n  - `REPO-AMOUNT-EXCEPTION`, `REPO-TOTAL-EXCEPTION` arrays\n  - Calls to `REPO-EXCEPTION-LN-PROCESS` for repo-specific reporting\n- Other programs (e.g., **SETIMP**) handle exceptions for deceased, fraud, and credit bureau statuses:\n```cobol\nIF DECEASED NOT = \"Y\"\n   IF LN-ACTIONCD = \"DCSD\"\n      MOVE \"ACCOUNT IN DECEASED STATUS\" TO D-EXCEPTION\n      PERFORM EXCEPT-LINE\n      GO TO NEXT-RECORD.\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:SETIMP.CBL|SETIMP.CBL]], Lines 376-400)\n\n---\n\n**RESEARCH PROCESSES IN OTIS**\n\n**1. Exception Research and Investigation**\n- When exceptions are detected, programs often move exception details to research files or buffers for further investigation.\n- Research processes include:\n  - Reading exception records from files (e.g., `EXCEPT-FILE`)\n  - Printing exception details for manual review\n  - Providing navigation for users to research screens\n\n**Example:**\n```cobol\nPERFORM START-EXCEPT-FILE.\nNEXT-EXCEPTION.\n   PERFORM READ-EXCEPT-FILE-NEXT.\n   IF IO-BAD\n      GO TO EXIT-PROCESS-EXCEPTION-TYPE.\n   IF EXCEPT-TYPE NOT = EXCEPTION-FG\n      GO TO EXIT-PROCESS-EXCEPTION-TYPE.\n   MOVE EXCEPT-GT1-KEY TO GT1-KEY.\n   PERFORM READ-GT1-FILE.\n   IF IO-BAD\n      GO TO IO-ERROR.\n   PERFORM EXCEPTION-PRINT.\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:WDAYBK.CBL|WDAYBK.CBL]], Lines 676-700)\n\n**2. Exception Research Screens and User Interaction**\n- Programs like **GRLST2** provide user interfaces for researching exceptions, allowing users to view, print, and investigate exception records.\n- Users can choose to print exceptions, accept them, or return for further research.\n\n**Example:**\n```cobol\nREC-EXCEPTIONS.\n   MOVE \"E  A000EXCP.\" TO VDU.\n   PERFORM SCREENIO.\n   IF VDUSTATUS = \"1>\" GO TO END-PROGRAM.\n   IF VDUSTATUS NOT = \"00\" GO TO REC-EXCEPTIONS.\n   MOVE VDUBUF TO PRINT-EXCEPTIONS.\n   IF PRINT-EXCEPTIONS = \"N\"\n      GO TO ACCEPT-IT.\n   IF PRINT-EXCEPTIONS NOT = \"Y\"\n      GO TO REC-EXCEPTIONS.\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:GRLST2.CBL|GRLST2.CBL]], Lines 526-550)\n\n**3. Exception File Management**\n- Exception records are written to and read from dedicated files for tracking and research.\n- Programs perform file operations such as OPEN, READ, WRITE, and REWRITE on exception files.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Key Programs and Processes:**\n\n| Program   | Exception Handling Role                                 | Research Role                        |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| LONPW9    | Loan payment/posting exceptions, repo exceptions        | Exception reporting, summary print   |\n| SETIMP    | Deceased/fraud/credit bureau status exceptions          | Exception line processing            |\n| WDAYBK    | General transaction exceptions, file-based research     | Exception file navigation/printing   |\n| GRLST2    | User interface for exception research                   | Print/accept/research exceptions     |\n| BULKG2    | Bulk transfer/repo exceptions                          | Exception routine for bulk records   |\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"420\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Exception Handling & Research Architecture</text>\n  \n  <!-- Exception Detection Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"70\" width=\"820\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#fee2e2\" stroke=\"#ef4444\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"95\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#b91c1c\">Exception Detection</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#b91c1c\">Programs: LONPW9, SETIMP, BULKG2, WDAYBK</text>\n  \n  <!-- Exception Logging/Reporting Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"160\" width=\"820\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#fef9c3\" stroke=\"#f59e0b\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"185\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#b45309\">Exception Logging & Reporting</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"210\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#b45309\">Arrays, Files, Summary Reports</text>\n  \n  <!-- Exception Research Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"250\" width=\"820\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"275\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Exception Research</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"300\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Programs: GRLST2, WDAYBK, User Screens</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"340\" width=\"820\" height=\"50\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"365\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Exception Files & Research Buffers</text>\n  \n  <!-- Connecting arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrow\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#666\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"160\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"230\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"320\" x2=\"450\" y2=\"340\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n**Source Citations:**\n- [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], Lines 2801-2850, 3101-3150, 1151-1175 (exception logic, reporting)\n- [[FILE:SETIMP.CBL|SETIMP.CBL]], Lines 376-425 (deceased/fraud/credit bureau exceptions)\n- [[FILE:WDAYBK.CBL|WDAYBK.CBL]], Lines 676-700 (exception file research)\n- [[FILE:GRLST2.CBL|GRLST2.CBL]], Lines 526-550 (exception research screen)\n- [[FILE:BULKG2.CBL|BULKG2.CBL]], Lines 1026-1050 (bulk repo exception handling)\n\nIf you need details on a specific exception type or research workflow, let me know!",

    "question": "How does OTIS manage document imaging and correspondence tracking?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages document imaging and correspondence tracking through a coordinated set of COBOL programs, structured file handling, and business logic designed to ensure every document and correspondence is properly recorded, retrievable, and auditable.\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Document imaging: Scans, stores, and indexes loan-related documents (e.g., disclosures, letters, cover pages) for compliance and operational efficiency.\n- Correspondence tracking: Records all outgoing/incoming communications (letters, notices, legal documents) linked to borrower accounts, enabling audit trails and research.\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Document Generation & Imaging:**\n   - Programs like **PST847**, **PST50K**, **PST334**, and **PST002** generate specific document types (disclosures, cover pages, personal property forms, collection letters).\n     - Example: PST847 creates disclosure documents for Mississippi loans (Source: [[FILE:PST847.CBL|PST847.CBL]], Index: code).\n     - Example: PST50K generates OCR cover pages for all states (Source: [[FILE:PST50K.CBL|PST50K.CBL]], Index: code).\n   - These programs format documents, assign form numbers, and prepare them for imaging.\n\n2. **Document Manifest & Indexing:**\n   - Programs such as **LONPM0** and **APIDOC** build a \"manifest\"—a structured record of all documents generated for a loan or borrower.\n     - Key fields include loan date, maker/comaker info, opt-out flags, and document type (Source: [[FILE:LONPM0.CBL|LONPM0.CBL]], Lines 676-700; [[FILE:APIDOC.CBL|APIDOC.CBL]], Lines 376-400).\n     - The manifest is written to a file for later retrieval and audit.\n\n3. **Imaging Workflow:**\n   - After document generation, routines like **WRITE-MANIFEST-FILE** and **CLOSE-MANIFEST-FILE** ensure the document and its metadata are stored and indexed (Source: [[FILE:APIDOC.CBL|APIDOC.CBL]], Lines 376-400).\n   - Imaging modules may interface with external systems or directories (e.g., **CHANGE-DIR-MODULE** in APIDOC) to store scanned images in the correct location (Source: [[FILE:APIDOC|APIDOC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n4. **Correspondence Tracking:**\n   - Each correspondence (letter, notice) is logged with borrower identifiers, document type, and date.\n   - Programs like **PSTPMC** and **PSTPMCW** handle specialized correspondence (e.g., laser form letters, linked workers), ensuring each item is tracked and retrievable (Source: [[FILE:PSTPMC|PSTPMC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows; [[FILE:PSTPMCW.CPY|PSTPMCW.CPY]], Lines 1-25).\n\n5. **Audit & Research Support:**\n   - The manifest and correspondence logs provide a searchable audit trail.\n   - Exception handling routines ensure missing or invalid documents are flagged for research (Source: [[FILE:LONPM0.CBL|LONPM0.CBL]], Lines 701-725).\n\n6. **Integration with Other Modules:**\n   - Document imaging and correspondence tracking are tightly integrated with loan processing, compliance, and reporting modules, ensuring all generated documents are linked to the correct business events.\n\n**EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:**\n1.

    "question": "What workflow processes exist for loan boarding and setup in OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) implements a structured, multi-step workflow for loan boarding and setup. This process ensures that new loans are accurately entered, validated, and integrated into the system, supporting both operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.\n\n**Workflow Processes for Loan Boarding and Setup in OTIS:**\n\n### 1. **Loan Data Entry**\n- **User Action:** Loan officers or branch staff initiate the loan boarding process via dedicated screens (e.g., \"LOAN MASTER FILE\", \"LOAN PAYMENT FILE\").\n- **Screen Prompts:** Users are guided through entry fields such as loan number, borrower details, payment terms, collateral codes, and proceeds.\n  - Example screen elements:\n    - \"LN/IN/DATE\", \"PMT DT/TRM\", \"PURPOSE CD\", \"COLLTRL CD\", \"SOURCE CD\", \"PROCEEDS/I\", \"INS/POINTS\", \"FEES\"  \n    (Source: [[FILE:S|S]]creen 1, Index: screen_nodes)\n\n### 2. **Validation and Compliance Checks**\n- **System Logic:** Upon entry, the system performs validation checks:\n  - Ensures required fields are completed\n  - Verifies codes (e.g., collateral, purpose) against master tables\n  - Checks for regulatory compliance (e.g., loan limits, fee structures)\n- **Error Handling:** Invalid entries prompt error messages and require correction before proceeding.\n\n### 3. **Loan Record Creation**\n- **File Management:** Once validated, the system creates records in the \"LOAN MASTER FILE\" and related files (e.g., \"BORROWER MASTER FILE\", \"LOAN PAYMENT FILE\").\n- **Automated Processes:** The system may auto-calculate amortization schedules, payment frequencies, and assign loan identifiers.\n\n### 4. **Document Imaging and Correspondence Tracking**\n- **Integration:** The workflow includes steps for scanning and attaching supporting documents (e.g., signed contracts, collateral documentation).\n- **Correspondence:** The system tracks outgoing correspondence (e.g., approval letters, disclosures) and logs them for audit purposes.\n  - (See previous answer: \"OTIS manages document imaging and correspondence tracking through coordinated COBOL programs and file handling.\")\n\n### 5. **Audit Trail and History Logging**\n- **Compliance:** Every action (entry, modification, approval) is logged in audit files, supporting regulatory requirements and future research.\n- **History Files:** The \"LOAN HISTORY FILE\" records all changes and transactions related to the loan.\n\n### 6. **Final Review and Approval**\n- **Workflow Routing:** Loans may require supervisor or automated approval before activation.\n- **Status Update:** Upon approval, the loan status is updated, and the loan becomes active in the system.\n\n### 7. **Exception Handling**\n- **Error/Research:** If issues arise (e.g., missing documents, failed validation), the workflow routes the loan to exception handling modules for research and resolution.\n  - (See previous answer: \"OTIS implements robust exception handling and research processes...\")\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Workflow Example:**\n\n1. **User accesses the \"Loan Master File\" screen**\n2. **Enters loan details (loan number, borrower, terms, collateral, etc.)**\n3. **System validates entries and checks compliance**\n4. **If valid, creates loan record and related payment schedule**\n5. **Scans and attaches supporting documents**\n6. **Logs all actions for audit trail**\n7. **Routes for approval if required**\n8. **Activates loan upon approval**\n9. **Handles exceptions and research if errors occur**\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"650\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\"

    "question": "How does OTIS handle payment reversals, adjustments, and corrections?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) handles payment reversals, adjustments, and corrections through a coordinated set of COBOL programs and business logic designed to ensure financial accuracy, auditability, and compliance. Here’s how these processes work:\n\n---\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE**\n\n- **Payment Reversals:** Allow users to undo previously posted payments due to errors, NSF (non-sufficient funds), or other business reasons.\n- **Adjustments:** Enable corrections to payment amounts, allocation between principal/interest, or reclassification of transactions.\n- **Corrections:** Address misapplied payments, incorrect transaction codes, or other posting errors.\n\nThese processes ensure that loan accounts reflect the true financial status and that all changes are tracked for audit and regulatory purposes.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### 1. **Payment Reversals**\n\n- **Trigger:** Typically initiated by user action (e.g., F6 from PAYDATE screen, as noted in [[FILE:LONIF1.CBL|LONIF1.CBL]]).\n- **Main Routine:** The reversal logic is handled in dedicated paragraphs such as `REVERSAL-ROUTINE` (Source: [[FILE:LONIF1.CBL|LONIF1.CBL]], Lines 1851-1875).\n- **Process Steps:**\n  - Identify the original transaction using account number, sequence number, and transaction code.\n  - Open relevant files (e.g., LP1-FILE) and retrieve transaction details.\n  - Reverse the effects by adjusting principal, interest, fees, and updating the cash drawer as needed.\n  - Special handling for batch payments, lock box transactions, and charge-off reversals (Source: [[FILE:LONPF8.CBL|LONPF8.CBL]], Lines 201-250).\n  - Update audit logs and maintain reversal history for compliance.\n\n**Example:**\n```cobol\n* PAYMENT REVERSAL ROUTINE\nREVERSAL-ROUTINE.\n    MOVE LP-TRCD TO HOLD-TRCD.\n    PERFORM OPEN-LP1-FILE.\n    MOVE LP-PATH-OWNBR TO LP-BRNO ...\n    MOVE LN-ACCTNO TO LP-ACCTNO ...\n    [Further logic to locate and reverse the payment]\n```\n(Source: [[FILE:LONIF1.CBL|LONIF1.CBL]], Lines 1851-1875)\n\n### 2. **Adjustments**\n\n- **Routine:** Adjustments are performed via dedicated adjustment programs (e.g., LPEADJ, LPDLADJ).\n- **Process Steps:**\n  - Compute new allocation for principal, interest, late charges, or fees.\n  - Update loan records and recalculate balances.\n  - Adjust GL (general ledger) entries as needed.\n  - Ensure all changes are logged and auditable.\n\n**Example:**\n- LPEADJ handles earned adjustment routines for interest and fees (Source: [[FILE:LPEADJ|LPEADJ]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n- LPDLADJ computes GL fee adjustments (Source: [[FILE:LPDLADJ|LPDLADJ]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n### 3. **Corrections**\n\n- **Routine:** Corrections are typically handled by programs that allow modification of transaction codes, amounts, or other attributes (e.g., LONPF2, LONPF8).\n- **Process Steps:**\n  - Locate the erroneous transaction.\n  - Apply corrections (e.g., change transaction code, fix amount).\n  - Update all affected files and ensure downstream effects (e.g., reporting, notifications) are handled.\n  - Maintain audit trail for all corrections.\n\n**Example:**\n- LONPF8 contains extensive business logic for handling reversals, including special cases for NSF, interbranch payments, and lock box transactions (Source: [[FILE:LONPF8.CBL|LONPF8.CBL]], Lines 101-150, 201-250, 301-325).\n\n---\n\n**KEY BUSINESS RULES & COMMENTS**\n\n- **Special Cases:** Certain transaction types (e.g., \"ES\" for escrow) cannot be reversed automatically and require manual intervention (Source: [[FILE:LONPF8.CBL|LONPF8.CBL]], Lines 301-325).\n- **Auditability:** All reversals and adjustments are logged for compliance (Source: [[FILE:APIPAY|APIPAY]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n- **Regulatory Handling:** Logic exists to ensure reversals comply with federal and state regulations, especially for charge-offs and lock box payments.\n\n---\n\n**PROGRAMS INVOLVED**\n\n| Program   | Purpose/Role                                         |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| LONIF1    | Main payment reversal routine                        |\n| LONPF8    | Handles complex reversal logic, adjustments, corrections |\n| LPEADJ    | Earned adjustment routines (interest/fees)           |\n| LPDLADJ   | Dealer adjustment routines (GL fees)                 |\n| APIPAY    | Payment posting, triggers reversal logic             |\n| LONPF2    | Payment update and correction logic                  |\n\n---\n\n**DATA FLOW**\n\n- **Input:** User selects transaction to reverse/adjust/correct.\n- **Processing:** Programs retrieve transaction, apply reversal/adjustment/correction logic, update loan/account files.\n- **Output:** Updated loan records, audit logs, notifications.\n\n---\n\n**EXCEPTION HANDLING**\n\n- **Error Conditions:** If reversal is not allowed (e.g., escrow payments), error messages are displayed and manual intervention is required.\n- **Audit Trail:** All changes are tracked for compliance and reporting.\n\n---\n\n**VISUAL REPRESENTATION:**\n\nHere's a visual representation of the payment reversal, adjustment, and

    "question": "What are the business rules engines or decision logic frameworks in OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) uses a combination of embedded business rules engines and decision logic frameworks within its COBOL programs and copybooks. These are not standalone \"engines\" in the modern sense, but rather structured sets of decision logic, validation routines, and rule tables implemented throughout the application to enforce business policies, regulatory requirements, and operational constraints.\n\n### Key Components of Business Rules and Decision Logic in OTIS\n\n#### 1. **88-Level Condition Names (COBOL Business Rules)**\n- OTIS programs and copybooks frequently use COBOL's 88-level condition names to define business rule values and valid states.\n- Example from [[FILE:LP01SPA_AREA.CPY|LP01SPA_AREA.CPY]]:\n  ```cobol\n  88  SPA-DISFRMLA-VALID          VALUE \"A\" \"B\" \"C\".\n  88  SPA-DISFRMLA-ACTUARIAL      VALUE \"A\".\n  88  SPA-DISFRMLA-ACTION-DATA    VALUE \"B\".\n  88  SPA-DISFRMLA-USRULE         VALUE \"C\".\n  ```\n  - These define valid formula types for loan calculations, enforcing business logic at the data level.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:LP01SPA_AREA.CPY|LP01SPA_AREA.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n#### 2. **Rule Tables and Lookup Copybooks**\n- Many copybooks act as rule tables, mapping codes to business meanings and controlling allowed operations.\n- Example: [[FILE:RESCINDW.CPY|RESCINDW.CPY]]\n  - Contains logic for rescission calculations, including business day limits and exception handling.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:RESCINDW.CPY|RESCINDW.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n#### 3. **Decision Paragraphs and Validation Routines**\n- Programs implement decision logic in dedicated paragraphs, often named VALIDATE, ENTRY-MODULE, or similar.\n- Example from [[FILE:SPMAN1.CBL|SPMAN1.CBL]]:\n  ```cobol\n  IF NOT SP-CONTRFRMLA-VALID\n     MOVE \"ENTER: SPACE OR 'A'\" TO MESS\n     PERFORM SEND-MESS\n     GO TO ENTER-ELE.\n  IF SP-CAL-RATETYPE(1) = \"Z\" AND SP-CONTRFRMLA = \"A\"\n     STRING \"TOTAL MONEY FORMULA NOT ALLOWED WITH \"\n            \"RATETYPE 'Z' INT METHOD\"\n            DELIMITED BY SIZE INTO MES\n  ```\n  - This enforces allowed combinations of formula and rate type, preventing invalid user input.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:SPMAN1.CBL|SPMAN1.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n#### 4. **Conditional Logic for Regulatory and Policy Enforcement**\n- Business rules are embedded to comply with regulations (e.g., loan term limits, payment rules).\n- Example from [[FILE:LNVERI.CBL|LNVERI.CBL]]:\n  - Comments and logic enforce maximum allowable loan terms and expiration dates, with error handling for violations.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:LNVERI.CBL|LNVERI.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n#### 5. **Rule-Based Calculation Routines**\n- Specialized paragraphs perform calculations based on rule codes.\n- Example from [[FILE:REBATE.CPY|REBATE.CPY]]:\n  ```cobol\n  IF SP-RBFRMLA2(REB-SUB) = \"3\"\n     PERFORM RULE-78THS-MEAN\n  ELSE IF SP-RBFRMLA2(REB-SUB) = \"4\"\n     PERFORM TN-PP-SHORT-RATE\n  ELSE IF SP-RBFRMLA2(REB-SUB) = \"6\"\n     PERFORM REBATE-ACTUARIAL-F-06\n  ```\n  - Each code triggers a different calculation method, reflecting business rules for rebates.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:REBATE.CPY|REBATE.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n#### 6. **Declarative and Initialization Sections**\n- Many programs use DECLARATIVES and INITIALIZATION paragraphs to set up rule contexts and enforce startup checks.\n- Example: LPEOD5, MBALR6H, SEBATD, SRBAC2\n  - These sections often initialize rule tables, set flags, and prepare the environment for rule enforcement.\n  - (Sources: LPEOD5, MBALR6H, SEBATD, SRBAC2, Index: flows)\n\n#### 7. **Copybook-Based Rule Sharing**\n- Copybooks like [[FILE:GB01BR.CPY|GB01BR.CPY]], [[FILE:LP01LN_SQL.CPY|LP01LN_SQL.CPY]], and others encapsulate rule definitions and are included across multiple programs to ensure consistent rule enforcement.\n\n### Summary Table: Example Rule Frameworks in OTIS\n\n| Component/Copybook         | Purpose/Business

Characteristics in OTIS\n\n- **Distributed:** Rules are embedded throughout programs and copybooks, not centralized.\n- **Declarative:** Uses COBOL condition names (88-levels) and rule tables for clarity.\n- **Procedural:** Decision logic is implemented in paragraphs and PERFORM routines.\n- **Extensible:** New rules can be added via copybooks and paragraph logic.\n- **Consistent:** Shared copybooks ensure rules are applied uniformly across modules.\n\n---\n\n### Here's a visual representation of how business rules are distributed and enforced in OTIS:\n\n<svg width=\"900\"

    "question_number": 32,
    "question": "How does OTIS support disaster recovery and business continuity processes?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) supports disaster recovery and business continuity through a combination of architectural design, programmatic controls, and operational procedures embedded in its COBOL application ecosystem. Here’s how these processes are implemented:\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Ensure that critical loan servicing operations can continue or be rapidly restored after system failures, data loss, or other disruptions.\n- Protect financial data integrity and maintain regulatory compliance.\n- Minimize downtime for essential functions such as payment processing, loan setup, and reporting.\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Data Redundancy and Backup:**\n   - OTIS programs frequently use file-level controls and batch processing routines to create backup copies of key data files (e.g., loan master, payment history, transaction logs).\n   - Programs such as BRCOPY and SECOPY include logic for copying, resetting, and auditing files, which supports periodic backup and restoration.\n     - Example: BRCOPY flow includes \"COPY-IT\", \"COPY-END\", and \"SEND-LEGEND\" steps for duplicating branch data (Source: [[FILE:BRCOPY|BRCOPY]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n   - End-of-day and end-of-period reporting programs (e.g., DBREPT, OPREPT) generate summary files that can be used for recovery checkpoints.\n\n2. **Audit Trails and Logging:**\n   - Many OTIS programs maintain detailed audit logs of transactions and changes, enabling rollback and forensic analysis after incidents.\n   - Programs like BRSECURE and DISBOV use copybooks such as [[FILE:BRSECUREW.CPY|BRSECUREW.CPY]] to track security events and changes (Source: [[FILE:DISBOV.CBL|DISBOV.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage).\n   - Logging routines are invoked at key points in workflows (e.g., \"LOG-CHANGES\" in BYRSUP, Source: [[FILE:BYRSUP|BYRSUP]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n3. **File Integrity and Validation:**\n   - Declarative sections in programs (e.g., \"DECLARATIVES\" in CPRUN, SRBAC9, PST608) handle file open/close operations and error recovery, ensuring files are not left in inconsistent states (Source: [[FILE:CPRUN|CPRUN]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n   - Programs perform validation checks before and after file operations, reducing risk of corruption.\n\n4. **Failover and Recovery Routines:**\n   - Specialized programs (e.g., SUPPORT, AND) are designed to be called during recovery scenarios to reinitialize or verify system state (Source: [[FILE:SUPPORT|SUPPORT]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs).\n   - Batch routines can be rerun to reconstruct data from backup files or audit logs.\n\n5. **Separation of Duties and Modular Design:**\n   - OTIS uses modular COBOL programs with clear separation between business logic, data access, and presentation layers.\n   - This design allows isolated recovery of affected modules without impacting the entire system.\n\n6. **Security and Access Controls:**\n   - Security programs (e.g., BRSECURE, PASSWD) enforce password verification and access restrictions, protecting recovery processes from unauthorized changes (Source: [[FILE:PASSWD|PASSWD]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n7. **Operational Procedures:**\n   - Regularly scheduled jobs (often run overnight or at period-end) perform backups, generate audit reports, and verify file integrity.\n   - Recovery documentation and scripts are maintained to guide operators through restoration steps.\n\n**VISUAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM:**\n\nHere's a visual representation of how disaster recovery and business continuity are supported in OTIS:\n\n<svg width=\"700\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Disaster Recovery Architecture</text>\n  \n  <!-- Presentation Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"70\" width=\"600\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"95\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Presentation Layer</text>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Screens: SCRN1, PGMENU, GTFORM</text>\n  \n  <!-- Business Logic Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"180\" width=\"600\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"205\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Business Logic Layer</text>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Programs: BRCOPY, SECOPY, BRSECURE, SUPPORT</text>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3b82f6\">Backup, Audit, Validation, Recovery</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Layer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"310\" width=\"600\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"335\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"18\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Data Layer</text>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"360\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#15803d\">Files: Loan Master, Payment History, Audit Logs</text>\n  <text x=\"350\" y=\"380\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">Backup & Recovery Storage</text>\n  \n  <!-- Connecting arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrow\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#666\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"350\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"350\" y2=\"180\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"350\" y1=\"280\" x2=\"350\" y2=\"310\" stroke=\"#666\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- OTIS supports disaster recovery and business continuity through backup routines, audit trails, file validation, modular recovery programs, and operational procedures.\n- Key programs: BRCOPY (file backup/copy), SECOPY (security backup), BRSECURE (audit/security), SUPPORT (recovery routines), PASSWD (access control).\n- Data integrity is maintained via regular backups, audit logs, and validation checks.\n- Modular design allows targeted recovery of affected subsystems.\n\n**Sources:**\n- BRCOPY flow and backup logic (Source: [[FILE:BRCOPY|BRCOPY]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- BRSECURE audit routines (Source: [[FILE:BRSECURE|BRSECURE]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- SUPPORT recovery program (Source: [[FILE:SUPPORT|SUPPORT]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs)\n- PASSWD security enforcement (Source: [[FILE:PASSWD|PASSWD]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- DISBOV audit copybook usage (Source: [[FILE:DISBOV.CBL|DISBOV.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage)\n- BYRSUP logging routines (Source: [[FILE:BYRSUP|BYRSUP]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\nIf you need details on specific recovery procedures or file-level backup logic, please specify the program or process for deeper analysis.",

    "question": "What data migration and conversion processes has OTIS undergone historically?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) has undergone extensive data migration and conversion processes over its history, reflecting both business needs and technical evolution. Here’s a summary of the major patterns and specific processes, based on retrieved code comments, copybook histories, and program documentation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Bulk Account Conversion and Purchase**\n- **Purpose:** Migrate large sets of accounts from legacy systems or acquired portfolios into OTIS.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Programs like **LONI**, **LONIE0**, and **EONIE0** include logic to distinguish between bulk purchases and account conversions.\n  - Field `BKCVFG` is used to determine whether a record is part of a bulk purchase or a conversion (Source: [[FILE:LONI.CBL|LONI.CBL]], lines 26-50).\n  - Special routines ensure that statistics and general ledger (GL) entries are preserved during conversion, preventing loss of financial data if the day is closed prematurely (Source: [[FILE:LONI.CBL|LONI.CBL]], lines 26-50).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Conversion Register and Snapshot Reporting**\n- **Purpose:** Provide an auditable snapshot of account states at the moment of conversion for compliance and reconciliation.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - The **CONVRP** program generates a \"snapshot\" report showing how accounts looked when converted (Source: [[FILE:CONVRP.CBL|CONVRP.CBL]], lines 51-75).\n  - Comments indicate the importance of matching loan entry dates and transaction dates, and recommend using the conversion register (EMTKRG) for accuracy if conversions span multiple months.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Field and Format Upgrades**\n- **Purpose:** Adapt data formats to new business requirements or regulatory standards.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Numerous copybooks and programs document upgrades such as:\n    - Changing account number formats (e.g., from 8-digit to 6+2 digit split for A15 output, Source: [[FILE:LTEXTR.CBL|LTEXTR.CBL]], lines 126-150).\n    - Adding new fields for compliance projects (e.g., CSI/CMSI project fields in [[FILE:LA01MA.CPY|LA01MA.CPY]], lines 26-50).\n    - Removing obsolete fields and files as business needs change (e.g., removal of LN-REVOLVING, PT0153 in [[FILE:BULKT2.CBL|BULKT2.CBL]], lines 326-350).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **File and Record Cleansing**\n- **Purpose:** Ensure migrated data meets current business rules and is free of legacy inconsistencies.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Programs like **UP1534** include logic to skip records prior to the year 2000 and cleanse specific fields (Source: [[FILE:UP1534.CBL|UP1534.CBL]], lines 101-125).\n  - Removal of hard-coded logic and duplicate keys during migration (Source: [[FILE:UP1534.CBL|UP1534.CBL]], lines 126-150).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Machine and Directory Migration**\n- **Purpose:** Move data between different hardware platforms or directory structures.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Routines to move data paths and machine identifiers, ensuring correct file placement and access after migration (Source: [[FILE:DSMAIN.CBL|DSMAIN.CBL]], lines 2326-2350).\n  - Use of utility programs (e.g., C$TOLOWER) to standardize machine names during conversion (Source: [[FILE:UP15VY.CBL|UP15VY.CBL]], lines 701-725).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Screen and Menu Conversion**\n- **Purpose:** Update user interfaces to support new conversion routines and workflows.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - The **[[FILE:LPMNUI.CPY|LPMNUI.CPY]]** copybook documents the evolution of conversion menus, including support for running conversion programs from multiple terminals (Source: [[FILE:LPMNUI.CPY|LPMNUI.CPY]], lines 1-25).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Error Handling and Audit Trails**\n- **Purpose:** Ensure integrity and traceability during migration.\n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Standardized error messages for records that have already been created, undergone change, or cannot be deleted due to active status (Source: [[FILE:EONIE0.CBL|EONIE0.CBL]], lines 601-625; [[FILE:SPMANH.CBL|SPMANH.CBL]], lines 1251-1275; [[FILE:RBMAIN.CBL|RBMAIN.CBL]], lines 701-725).\n  - Audit trails and status flags are maintained to track conversion progress and issues.\n\n---\n\n## **Historical Patterns and Business Drivers**\n\n- **Acquisition Integration:** Bulk conversions often follow acquisitions, requiring mapping of external data formats to OTIS standards.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Field upgrades and cleansing routines reflect changing regulatory requirements (e.g., CSI/CMSI projects).\n- **Platform Modernization:** Migration between machines and directories supports hardware upgrades and disaster recovery planning.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** Removal of obsolete logic and files, addition of new fields, and menu enhancements show ongoing adaptation to business needs.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Programs and Copybooks Involved**\n\n| Program/Copybook      | Purpose/Role                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LONI, LONIE0, EONIE0  | Bulk purchase/account conversion logic, GL/statistics preservation            |\n| CONVRP                | Conversion snapshot reporting, audit trail                                    |\n| UP1534                | Cleansing, record skipping, field upgrades                                   |\n| BULKT2                | Bulk file/tag updates, removal of obsolete fields                            |\n| DSMAIN                | Data path/machine migration routines                                         |\n| [[FILE:LPMNUI.CPY|LPMNUI.CPY]]            | Conversion menu evolution                                                    |\n| [[FILE:LA01MA.CPY|LA01MA.CPY]]            | Field upgrades for compliance projects                                       |\n| [[FILE:LTEXTR.CBL|LTEXTR.CBL]]            | Account number format conversion                                             |\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nOTIS’s data migration and conversion processes have evolved to support:\n- Bulk account integration\n- Accurate snapshot/audit reporting\n- Field and format upgrades\n- Data cleansing and error handling\n- Machine and directory migration\n- User interface adaptation\n\nThese processes are embedded in both business logic and technical routines, ensuring that OTIS remains robust, compliant, and adaptable to changing business and regulatory environments.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [[FILE:LONI.CBL|LONI.CBL]], lines 26-50\n- [[FILE:CONVRP.CBL|CONVRP.CBL]], lines 51-75\n- [[FILE:LTEXTR.CBL|LTEXTR.CBL]], lines 126-150\n- [[FILE:BULKT2.CBL|BULKT2.CBL]], lines 326-350\n- [[FILE:UP1534.CBL|UP1534.CBL]], lines 101-125, 126-150\n- [[FILE:DSMAIN.CBL|DSMAIN.CBL]], lines 2326-2350\n- [[FILE:LPMNUI.CPY|LPMNUI.CPY]], lines 1-25\n- [[FILE:LA01MA.CPY|LA01MA.CPY]], lines 26-50\n- [[FILE:EONIE0.CBL|EONIE0.CBL]], lines 601-625\n- [[FILE:SPMANH.CBL|SPMANH.CBL]], lines 1251-1275\n- [[FILE:RBMAIN.CBL|RBMAIN.CBL]], lines 701-725\n\nIf you need a detailed flowchart or want to see specific migration routines in diagram form, let me know!",

    "question_number": 34,
    "question": "How does OTIS manage rate changes and payment recalculations?",
    "answer": "OTIS manages rate changes and payment recalculations through a combination of specialized COBOL programs, copybooks, and embedded business logic. The system is designed to handle complex financial scenarios such as interest rate adjustments, payment schedule recalculations, and regulatory compliance for loans and related products.\n\n### BUSINESS PURPOSE\n\n- **Rate Changes:** OTIS supports dynamic updates to loan interest rates, including scheduled changes, regulatory caps, and special formulas (e.g., promotional rates, balloon payments).\n- **Payment Recalculations:** When rates change, OTIS recalculates payment amounts, schedules, and related financial fields to ensure accurate billing and compliance.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** The system enforces business rules such as maximum allowable rates, rounding conventions, and state-specific calculations.\n\n### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n#### 1. **Specialized Programs for Rate and Payment Logic**\n- **LPRATE:** Handles rate calculations, comparisons, and updates. It uses formulas to determine new rates and applies caps or special rules as needed.\n  - Entry paragraphs: `LPRATE-CALC-IT`, `LPRATE-COMPARE-RATES`, `LPRATE-USE-RATES` (Source: [[FILE:LPRATE|LPRATE]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- **CALCZL / CALCZ3:** Perform actuarial and amortization calculations for loans, including recalculating payments when rates or terms change.\n  - Handles rounding, convergence issues, and maximum term logic (Source: [[FILE:CALCZL|CALCZL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows; CALCZ3, Index: variables)\n- **LPPOFF / FAPOFF:** Manage payoff calculations, including recalculating interest, penalties, and rebates when rates change or loans are paid off early.\n  - Includes logic for state-specific rules (e.g., California recast) (Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CPY|LPPOFF.CPY]], [[FILE:FAPOFF.CPY|FAPOFF.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n#### 2. **Copybooks for Rate and Payment Structures**\n- **LIBLP/[[FILE:LPRATE.CPY|LPRATE.CPY]]:** Defines rate tables, formulas, and fields used in rate calculations (Source: [[FILE:MBNOFL|MBNOFL]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: copybook_usage)\n- **LIBLP/[[FILE:LPAMTS.CPY|LPAMTS.CPY]]:** Contains payment amount structures and related fields (Source: [[FILE:MBCORP|MBCORP]], [[FILE:MBCORP1|MBCORP1]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: copybook_usage)\n- **LIBLP/[[FILE:LP01LP.CPY|LP01LP.CPY]], LIBLP/[[FILE:LP01LN.CPY|LP01LN.CPY]]:** Store loan and payment record layouts, including fields for rates, terms, and payment schedules (Source: [[FILE:LPMAN3|LPMAN3]], [[FILE:LPMAN2|LPMAN2]], [[FILE:REBT01|REBT01]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: copybook_usage)\n\n#### 3. **Embedded Business Rules and Decision Logic**\n- **Conditional Logic:** Programs use IF/EVALUATE statements to apply business rules, such as:\n  - Capping rates at regulatory maximums\n  - Applying special formulas for balloons or promotional loans\n  - Rounding payments according to business policy\n  - Example: \n    ```cobol\n    IF LN-OVRDRATE NOT = 999.999\n       MOVE LN-ORIG-1STPYDATE TO NDTE-DATE\n       PERFORM SET-PY-RATE\n    ```\n    (Source: [[FILE:LPPOFF.CPY|LPPOFF.CPY]], Index: code)\n- **Rate Table Indexing:** Logic to select appropriate rate from tables based on loan attributes (Source: [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]], Index: code)\n- **Recalculation Triggers:** Payment recalculation is triggered by events such as rate changes, loan modifications, or payoff requests.\n\n#### 4. **Workflow Example**\nWhen a rate change occurs:\n1. **Trigger:** User or batch process initiates a rate change for a loan.\n2. **Rate Calculation:** LPRATE or CALCZL recalculates the new rate using formulas and tables.\n3. **Payment Recalculation:** CALCZL or CALCZ3 computes new payment amounts and schedules.\n4. **Update Records:** LPPOFF or FAPOFF updates loan records, payoff amounts, and schedules.\n5. **Compliance Checks:** Business rules ensure rates and payments comply with regulations.\n6. **Notification:** System may generate notices or update screens to inform users/customers.\n\n#### 5. **Historical Context**\n- The system has evolved to handle increasingly complex rate and payment scenarios, with revisions noted for regulatory changes, bug fixes, and new product features (Source: [[FILE:LPAPRS.CPY|LPAPRS.CPY]], Index: code).\n\n---\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nHere's a visual representation of the

    "question": "What quality control and reconciliation processes are built into OTIS?",
    "answer": "OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) incorporates robust quality control and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and compliance across its financial operations. These processes are implemented through dedicated COBOL programs, specialized copybooks, and structured workflows. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Quality Control Processes**\n\n**A. Programmatic Validation**\n- Many OTIS programs include validation routines that check for data consistency, correct formats, and business rule compliance before processing transactions.\n- Example: Programs like **CHKSEC** (Source: [[FILE:CHKSEC|CHKSEC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs) are called by 59 other programs to perform security and validation checks, ensuring only authorized and valid transactions proceed.\n\n**B. Audit Trails**\n- Programs such as **AUDIQ0** and **AUDIQ1** (Source: [[FILE:AUDIQ0|AUDIQ0]], [[FILE:AUDIQ1|AUDIQ1]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows) maintain audit logs by recording key actions, changes, and user inputs. This supports traceability and post-process review.\n\n**C. Error Handling and Logging**\n- Error routines are embedded in most transaction programs, capturing exceptions and logging them for review. This includes both system errors and business rule violations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Reconciliation Processes**\n\n**A. Dedicated Reconciliation Programs**\n- The **RECONC** program is central to OTIS’s reconciliation workflow (Source: [[FILE:RECONC|RECONC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs, flows).\n  - **Business Purpose:** RECONC matches and verifies financial records, ensuring that totals, balances, and transactions align across subsystems.\n  - **Technical Implementation:** It performs initialization, creates work files, writes detail lines, prints grand totals, and range lines (Source: [[FILE:RECONC|RECONC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n**B. Supporting Copybooks**\n- RECONC uses a suite of copybooks to structure and manage reconciliation data:\n  - **LIBGL/[[FILE:GL01GT.CPY|GL01GT.CPY]]** – General ledger transaction definitions (Source: [[FILE:RECONC.CBL|RECONC.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage)\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GBFSWKI.CPY|GBFSWKI.CPY]]** – Financial summary work item structures\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GBFDPR.CPY|GBFDPR.CPY]]** – Financial detail processing records\n  - **LIBSP/[[FILE:RECONC_DEF.CPY|RECONC_DEF.CPY]]** – Reconciliation definitions\n  - **LIBSP/[[FILE:RECONC_SCN.CPY|RECONC_SCN.CPY]]** – Screen definitions for reconciliation\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GBGRGS_SQL.CPY|GBGRGS_SQL.CPY]]** – SQL routines for group reconciliation\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:SCREENW.CPY|SCREENW.CPY]]** – Common screen handling for reconciliation\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:CONAME_EXT.CPY|CONAME_EXT.CPY]]** – Extended company name structures\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GBWSGR.CPY|GBWSGR.CPY]]** – Work summary group records\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GETFMW.CPY|GETFMW.CPY]]** – Get financial work records\n  - **LIBGB/[[FILE:GBFSPR.CPY|GBFSPR.CPY]]** – Financial summary processing records\n\n**C. Reconciliation Workflow**\n- The reconciliation process typically follows these steps:\n  1. **Initialization:** Set up work files and prepare for reconciliation.\n  2. **Record Matching:** Compare transaction records across files (e.g., loan, payment, general ledger).\n  3. **Detail Writing:** Log matched and unmatched records for review.\n  4. **Totals Calculation:** Print grand totals and range lines for summary.\n  5. **Reporting:** Generate reports for discrepancies and matched records.\n\n**D. Integration with Other Programs**\n- RECONC is called by other programs and also calls additional modules for specialized reconciliation tasks (Source: [[FILE:RECONC|RECONC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs).\n- Related programs such as **RECAPJ**, **DBREPT**, and **RCFILE** also participate in reconciliation and reporting, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Sample Reconciliation Flow (RECONC)**\n\n**Business Flow:**\n- User initiates reconciliation → RECONC initializes work files → Matches records → Writes details → Prints totals → Generates reports.\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n- DECLARATIVES → INITIALIZATION → CREATE-GT-WORK → WRITE-DETAIL-LINE → PRINT-GRAND-TOTALS → PRINT-RANGE-LINES (Source: [[FILE:RECONC|RECONC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex:

    "question_number": 38,
    "question": "How do customer service agents use OTIS to respond to customer inquiries?",
    "answer": "Customer service agents use the OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) application to efficiently respond to customer inquiries related to loan servicing, account status, payments, and general account maintenance. Here’s how the process works:\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Agents provide real-time information and support to customers regarding their loan accounts.\n- They handle requests such as account balance inquiries, payment history, transaction details, and status updates.\n- Agents may also assist with updating customer information, resolving discrepancies, and initiating service requests.\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Accessing Inquiry Screens:**\n   - Agents log into OTIS and navigate to inquiry modules such as CPINQ0 (Customer Payment Inquiry), RXSCAN (Range Scan Inquiry), or other relevant screens.\n   - These modules are designed to capture search criteria (e.g., account number, customer name) and display detailed account information.\n\n2. **Processing the Inquiry:**\n   - The agent enters customer identifiers (account number, name, etc.) into the system.\n   - The inquiry program (e.g., CPINQ0) performs validation and retrieves data from underlying files and databases.\n   - Example flow from CPINQ0 (Source: [[FILE:CPINQ0|CPINQ0]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows):\n     - MAIN-MODULE → FORM-RESET (prepares screen)\n     - ENTER-KEYS → GET-LC (fetches loan/customer data)\n     - SET-COLLECTOR-INFO (populates agent details)\n     - SEND-DELINQ-SCAN (initiates delinquency scan if needed)\n\n3. **Displaying Results:**\n   - The system displays account details, payment history, delinquency status, and other relevant information on the screen.\n   - If the inquiry is about a specific transaction or payment, modules like RXSCAN or BULKTR may be used to scan ranges or verify transaction existence.\n\n4. **Responding to the Customer:**\n   - Agents review the information and communicate results to the customer.\n   - If discrepancies or errors are found, agents may initiate further investigation or escalate to specialized teams.\n\n5. **Additional Actions:**\n   - Agents can update certain customer details, initiate service requests, or trigger follow-up actions (e.g., sending confirmation emails via EMAIL program).\n   - All actions are logged for audit and quality control purposes.\n\n**Example Program Flows Supporting Inquiries:**\n\n- **CPINQ0 (Customer Payment Inquiry):**\n  - Handles payment inquiries, validates input, retrieves payment and loan data, and displays results.\n  - Flow includes modules for form reset, key entry, data retrieval, and collector info setup.\n\n- **RXSCAN (Range Scan Inquiry):**\n  - Allows agents to scan account ranges, display results, and send legends for clarification.\n  -

    "question": "What capabilities do collection specialists have in OTIS for delinquent accounts?",
    "answer": "Collection specialists in the OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) application have a robust set of capabilities for managing delinquent accounts. Their functions are designed to support the full lifecycle of collections, from identifying delinquency to generating reports and initiating follow-up actions.\n\n**Key Capabilities for Collection Specialists in OTIS:**\n\n### 1. **Identifying and Reviewing Delinquent Accounts**\n- Specialists can access screens and reports that highlight accounts with overdue payments, including detailed delinquency status and aging buckets (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days past due).\n- They can view account details, payment history, and current balances to assess the severity of delinquency.\n  - Example: The \"Collection Information\" section on screens such as [[FILE:LNMAN8_SCN.CPY|LNMAN8_SCN.CPY]] displays collector IDs and delinquency data (Source: [[FILE:LNMAN8_SCN.CPY|LNMAN8_SCN.CPY]], Index: code).\n\n### 2. **Generating Collection Letters and Reports**\n- The COLLET program produces the \"Most Recent Collection Letter Report,\" allowing specialists to generate and review letters sent to delinquent customers (Source: [[FILE:COLLET.CBL|COLLET.CBL]], Index: code).\n- Specialists can run reports to track which accounts have received collection communications and monitor follow-up status.\n  - Example: COLRPT program generates detailed reports on worked accounts and result codes, helping track collection effectiveness (Source: [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]], Index: code).\n\n### 3. **Recording Collection Actions and Results**\n- Specialists can update account records to indicate actions taken (e.g., calls made, letters sent, promises to pay).\n- The system tracks \"worked account\" flags and result codes, ensuring that each collector’s activity is logged and visible for audit and follow-up (Source: [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]], Index: code).\n\n### 4. **Managing Collector Assignments and Work Queues**\n- OTIS supports assignment of accounts to specific collectors, enabling workload balancing and targeted follow-up.\n- Specialists can review and update collector IDs, behavior risk factors, and sequence flags for each account (Source: [[FILE:CQMAIN.CBL|CQMAIN.CBL]], Index: code).\n\n### 5. **Initiating Follow-Up Actions**\n- The system allows specialists to schedule follow-up dates, generate reminders, and escalate accounts as needed.\n- They can use screens to enter notes, set next action dates, and trigger additional communications.\n\n### 6. **Computing Delinquency and Arrearage Amounts**\n- Programs like LPCDEL compute the contractual delinquent amount and arrearage for each account, providing accurate financial data for collection efforts (Source: [[FILE:LPCDEL.CPY|LPCDEL.CPY]], Index: code).\n- Specialists can view these computed amounts to prioritize accounts and tailor collection strategies.\n\n### 7. **Reviewing Collection History and Compliance**\n- Specialists have access to historical data on collection actions, ensuring compliance with company policies and regulatory requirements.\n- The system prevents duplicate actions and flags accounts that have already been worked by any collector within a branch (Source: [[FILE:COLRPT.CBL|COLRPT.CBL]], Index: code).\n\n---\n\n**Business Purpose:**\n- Enable efficient, compliant, and documented collection efforts for delinquent accounts.\n- Support specialists in prioritizing accounts, tracking actions, and improving recovery rates.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Programs: COLLET, COLRPT, LPCDEL, CQMAIN, LNMAN8_SCN, among others.\n- Data: Delinquency status, collector assignments, action/result codes, computed arrearage.\n- Screens: Display collection info, allow entry of actions, generate reports and letters.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation of the main collection specialist workflow in

    "question_number": 42,
    "question": "How do managers and supervisors use OTIS for oversight and approvals?",
    "answer": "Managers and supervisors use OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) primarily for oversight, approvals, and control of key business processes—especially those involving loans, financial transactions, and user activity. Their functions are designed to ensure compliance, enforce business rules, and provide auditability across the system.\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- **Loan Approval Oversight:** Managers review and approve loan applications, set approval limits, and verify that transactions comply with company policies and regulatory requirements.\n- **Exception Handling:** Supervisors can override certain limits, approve exceptions, and manage special cases (e.g., Premier Advisory customers).\n- **Audit and Review:** They access detailed logs, approval histories, and can review branch-level statistics and transaction details for compliance and performance monitoring.\n- **User Management:** Supervisors may have authority to manage user access, reset passwords, and configure approval workflows.\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Approval Windows and Limits:**\n   - Managers interact with approval windows that display loan details, approval limits, and user IDs.\n   - They can set or adjust approval limits for themselves or others, with logic enforcing maximums and requiring justification for overrides.\n   - Example (from [[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]]):\n     ```cobol\n     MOVE HOLD-APPROVAL-LIMIT    TO PD-APPROVAL-LIMIT.\n     MOVE HOLD-APPROVAL-USERID   TO PD-APPROVAL-USERID.\n     PERFORM SEND-LNAPPROVAL-LEGEND.\n     IF GP-GROUP-APPROVAL-FG = \"Y\"\n        IF ( VDUNUM0 > GI-LN-APPROVAL-LIMIT ) AND\n           ( VDUNUM0 > HOLD-GR-APPROVAL-LIMIT )\n           MOVE \"TOTAL REPAY AMT EXCEEDS YOUR APPROVAL AUTHORITY!\" TO MESS\n     ```\n     (Source: [[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n2. **Special Handling for Premier Customers:**\n   - Supervisors have logic to handle Premier Advisory customers differently, using loan amount rather than financed amount for approvals.\n   - Example comment:\n     ```\n     * CHANGE FOR PREMIER TO USE LOAN AMOUNT (PD-LNAMT)\n     * INSTEAD OF FINANCED AMOUNT (FINANCED-AMOUNT).\n     ```\n     (Source: [[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n3. **Approval Workflow and Messaging:**\n   - Approval actions trigger notifications and update logs, ensuring traceability.\n   - Approval information is sent to display buffers and forms for user confirmation.\n   - Example:\n     ```cobol\n     MOVE DISPLAY-APPROVAL-WINDOW-LIST TO WR-LIST.\n     MOVE DISPLAY-APPROVAL-WINDOW-BUF TO WR-BUF.\n     PERFORM CALL-WRFORM.\n     ```\n     (Source: [[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n4. **Audit Trail and Comments:**\n   - Managers can add comments and memos to approval actions, which are logged for future review.\n   - Example (from [[FILE:PTHMOD.CBL|PTHMOD.CBL]]):\n     ```cobol\n     STRING \"USERID MANAGER: \",LSP-BR-MANAGER-USERID DELIMITED BY \"   \" INTO DF-MEMO1.\n     MOVE LSP-BR-MANAGER-DATE TO DATE-YYYYMMDD.\n     PERFORM UPDATE-DF-MEMO.\n     ```\n     (Source: [[FILE:PTHMOD.CBL|PTHMOD.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n5. **Branch and Group-Level Controls:**\n   - Supervisors can view and manage approval limits at the branch or group level, ensuring that only authorized users can approve large transactions.\n   - Approval limits and authority flags are checked before allowing actions.\n\n**KEY COPYBOOKS INVOLVED:**\n- **[[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]]** – Loan approval verification and window logic\n- **[[FILE:LNAPPROVALW.CPY|LNAPPROVALW.CPY]]** – Loan approval workers (standard/window)\n- **[[FILE:PTHMOD_SCN.CPY|PTHMOD_SCN.CPY]]** – Screen definitions for approval and comments\n- **[[FILE:GICOPY.CBL|GICOPY.CBL]]** – Approval limit handling for GI (group insurance) loans\n\n**SUMMARY OF MANAGER/SUPERVISOR WORKFLOW:**\n1. Access approval screens showing pending transactions and limits.\n2. Review transaction details, including customer type and loan amount.\n3. Approve, deny, or override transactions based on authority and business rules.\n4. Add comments or memos for audit trail.\n5. System enforces limits and logs all actions for compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation of the manager/supervisor approval workflow in OTIS:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Manager/Supervisor Approval Workflow</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 1: Access Approval Screen -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Access Approval Screen</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"11\">View pending transactions</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 2: Review Details -->\n  <rect x=\"300\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#4ade80\" stroke=\"#16a34a\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Review Transaction Details</text>\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"11\">Loan amount, customer type</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 3: Approve/Override -->\n  <rect x=\"550\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"650\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Approve / Override</text>\n  <text x=\"650\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"11\">Check limits, enter comments</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 4: Audit Trail -->\n  <rect x=\"300\" y=\"200\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#15803d\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Audit Trail & Logging</text>\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#15803d\" font-size=\"11\">Record approval, comments</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 5: Compliance Check -->\n  <rect x=\"550\" y=\"200\" width=\"200\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#ef4444\" stroke=\"#dc2626\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"650\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\">Compliance Enforcement</text>\n  <text x=\"650\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" font-size=\"11\">Enforce limits, notify errors</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"250\" y1=\"115\" x2=\"300\" y2=\"115\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"500\" y1=\"115\" x2=\"550\" y2=\"115\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"650\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"400\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"650\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"650\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n**Sources:**\n- [[FILE:LNAPPROVAL.CPY|LNAPPROVAL.CPY]], Index: code (approval logic, limits, comments)\n- [[FILE:LNAPPROVALW.CPY|LNAPPROVALW.CPY]], Index: code (approval workers, window handling)\n- [[FILE:PTHMOD.CBL|PTHMOD.CBL]], Index: code (manager comments, audit trail)\n- [[FILE:GICOPY.CBL|GICOPY.CBL]], Index: code (approval limit handling)\n\nIf you need details on specific approval screens or the exact fields managers can modify, please specify the screen or function.",

    "question": "What reporting and analytics access do business analysts have in OTIS?",
    "answer": "Business analysts in OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) have robust access to reporting and analytics features designed to support data-driven decision-making and operational insight. Their access typically includes:\n\n**REPORTING ACCESS:**\n- **Standard Financial Reports:** Business analysts can generate and review core financial reports such as trial balances, aged receivables, delinquency summaries, and branch-level performance reports. These are produced by programs like DBREPT, MBALR2, MBALR3, MBALR4, MBALR5, MBALR6, and MBALR6H, which handle various aspects of financial and operational reporting.\n- **Custom and Ad Hoc Reports:** Analysts can run specialized reports for targeted business questions, such as potential increased loan opportunities (e.g., PILRPT – \"Potential Increased Loan Report\") or motor club claims (e.g., CLMCUP).\n- **Branch and Group Analysis:** Programs such as GRLIST and CDLIST allow for listing and analysis of branch/group data, supporting comparative analytics across organizational units.\n\n**ANALYTICS ACCESS:**\n- **Data Extraction and Aggregation:** Programs like MBAGE1, MBAGED, MBANR2, MBUNR1H, and RZCORP support extraction and aggregation of loan, branch, and customer data for deeper analysis.\n- **Trend and Performance Analysis:** Business analysts can use reporting modules to analyze trends in loan performance, charge-offs, recoveries, and other key metrics. Copybooks such as [[FILE:SPWR1IN.CPY|SPWR1IN.CPY]] and [[FILE:UPAWRCL.CPY|UPAWRCL.CPY]] define fields for financial metrics (e.g., net finance charges, sales, expenses, recovery income) that feed into these analytics.\n- **GL and Accounting Data:** Access to general ledger and accounting data is provided via programs like DBREPT and supporting copybooks (e.g., LIBGB/[[FILE:GB01BR.CPY|GB01BR.CPY]], LIBGB/[[FILE:GBWSGR.CPY|GBWSGR.CPY]]), enabling reconciliation and financial oversight.\n\n**ACCESS MECHANISMS:**\n- **Menu-Driven Navigation:** Business analysts interact with OTIS through menu screens that route them to reporting modules. While the exact menu text is not present in the retrieved context, the structure allows selection of various report types and analytics functions.\n- **Parameter Entry:** Analysts can specify parameters (date ranges, branch codes, report types) to tailor reports to their needs.\n- **Export and Print Options:** Many reports can be exported or printed for further analysis outside the system.\n\n**EXAMPLES OF REPORTING PROGRAMS AND COPYBOOKS:**\n\n| Program/Copybook         | Description

Here’s how OTIS supports their oversight:\n\n**BUSINESS PURPOSE:**\n- Ensure all loan and financial activities comply with federal, state, and internal regulations.\n- Detect and prevent violations related to insurance, lending, and consumer protection.\n- Provide evidence of compliance for audits and regulatory reviews.\n\n**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**\n\n1. **Compliance Monitoring Programs:**\n   - Programs like **ADDEXT** are specifically designed for compliance control.  \n     - *Example*: ADDEXT checks for overlapping AD&D (Accidental Death & Dismemberment) insurance policies to ensure system controls are functioning as expected.\n     - It generates tab-delimited extracts for further analysis and only includes loans with sold AD&D insurance.\n     - (Source: [[FILE:ADDEXT.CBL|ADDEXT.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n2. **Automated Compliance Reports:**\n   - OTIS produces regular extracts and reports (e.g., `/USR/EXTRACT/OPS/ADDEXP`) that highlight compliance status and exceptions.\n   - These reports allow compliance officers to review system-wide adherence and investigate anomalies.\n\n3. **Audit Trails and Change Logs:**\n   - Programs log changes to sensitive fields (such as compliance codes, insurance flags, and approval statuses).\n   - Example:  \n     - Loan file programs record changes to fields like `LN-TRW-COMPLIANCE-CODE` and `LN-1099-C-FG`, and log discrepancies for review.\n     - (Source: [[FILE:LNFILE.CBL|LNFILE.CBL]], Index: code; [[FILE:LNFILU.CBL|LNFILU.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n4. **Exception Handling and Alerts:**\n   - If a compliance rule is violated (e.g., invalid insurance overlap, missing regulatory codes), the system generates error records and notifies responsible officers.\n   - Error handling routines ensure that unresolved compliance issues are flagged and require attention before further processing.\n\n5. **Regulatory Data Extraction:**\n   - Dedicated programs extract data required for regulatory filings (such as 1099 forms, consumer compliance codes).\n   - These extracts are reviewed by compliance officers for accuracy and completeness.\n\n6. **Access Controls:**\n   - Compliance officers have privileged access to compliance modules and reports, ensuring only authorized personnel can review or modify regulatory data.\n\n**TYPICAL WORKFLOW:**\n1. Compliance officer logs into OTIS and accesses the compliance dashboard or reporting module.\n2. Reviews automated extracts and exception reports for regulatory adherence.\n3. Investigates flagged transactions or loans with compliance issues.\n4. Uses audit trail features to trace changes and verify corrective actions.\n5. Prepares regulatory filings or responds to audit requests using system-generated data.\n\n**Key Programs Supporting Compliance Monitoring:**\n| Program   | Purpose                                                        |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ADDEXT    | Monitors overlapping AD&D insurance policies                   |\n| LNFILE    | Logs changes to compliance codes and flags                     |\n| LNFILU    | Records discrepancies in regulatory fields for audit           |\n| Various reporting modules | Generate compliance extracts and exception lists |\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"420\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Compliance Monitoring Workflow</text>\n  \n  <!-- Compliance Officer -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"180\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"140\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Compliance Officer</text>\n  <text x=\"140\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#6366f1\">Accesses OTIS</text>\n  \n  <!-- Compliance Modules -->\n  <rect x=\"270\" y=\"80\" width=\"180\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"360\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">Compliance Modules</text>\n  <text x=\"360\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3b82f6\">ADDEXT, LNFILE, LNFILU</text>\n  \n  <!-- Automated Reports -->\n  <rect x=\"490\" y=\"80\" width=\"180\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"580\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Automated Reports</text>\n  <text x=\"580\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">Extracts, Exception Lists</text>\n  \n  <!-- Audit Trail -->\n  <rect x=\"710\" y=\"80\" width=\"140\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#fef9c3\" stroke=\"#f59e0b\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"780\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#b45309\">Audit Trail</text>\n  <text x=\"780\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#f59e0b\">Change Logs</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"230\" y1=\"110\" x2=\"270\" y2=\"110\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"110\" x2=\"490\" y2=\"110\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"670\" y1=\"110\" x2=\"710\" y2=\"110\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Review/Investigation -->\n  <rect x=\"270\" y=\"200\" width=\"320\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">Review & Investigation</text>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#6366f1\">Flagged Transactions, Discrepancies</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows from modules/reports/audit trail to review -->\n  <line x1=\"360\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"360\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"580\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"580\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"780\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"780\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Regulatory Filings -->\n  <rect x=\"270\" y=\"320\" width=\"320\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"350\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Regulatory Filings & Audit Response</text>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"370\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">Uses system-generated data</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrow from review to filings -->\n  <line x1=\"430\" y1=\"260\" x2=\"430\" y2=\"320\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n**Summary:**  \nCompliance officers in OTIS use dedicated compliance modules, automated reporting, and audit trail features to monitor regulatory adherence, investigate exceptions, and prepare for audits.

    "question": "What audit and review capabilities exist for internal and external auditors?",
    "answer": "OTIS provides comprehensive audit and review capabilities for both internal and external auditors, supporting oversight, compliance verification, and operational transparency.\n\n**Audit and Review Capabilities in OTIS:**\n\n**1. Automated Audit Trail Generation**\n- OTIS modules such as AUDEXT, AUDEXT-MB, AUDITW, and related programs are designed to record detailed audit trails of system activity.\n- These programs capture transaction details, user actions, approvals, and changes to key data, ensuring a reliable record for later review.\n- Example: The AUDEXT program is described as \"AUDITORS REPORT OF CONFIDENTIAL ACCTS\" (Source: [[FILE:LNAURP.CBL|LNAURP.CBL]], Index: code), indicating its role in generating audit reports for sensitive accounts.\n\n**2. Audit File Management**\n- Programs like AUDEXT and AUDEXT-MB handle the opening, writing, and closing of audit files, ensuring that all relevant events are logged.\n- Code Example:\n  ```cobol\n  OPEN-AUDIT-FILE-OUTPUT.\n      PERFORM OPEN-IT.\n      MOVE AUDIT-PATH TO E-FILE.\n      OPEN OUTPUT AUDIT-FILE.\n      IF IO-FG = 8\n         GO TO OPEN-AUDIT-FILE-OUTPUT.\n      IF IO-FG = 7\n         CLOSE AUDIT-FILE\n         GO TO OPEN-AUDIT-FILE-OUTPUT.\n  WRITE-AUDIT-FILE.\n      PERFORM WRITE-IT.\n      MOVE AUDIT-PATH TO E-FILE.\n      WRITE AUDIT-REC.\n      IF IO-FG = 8\n        GO TO WRITE-AUDIT-FILE.\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:MBDEX2.CBL|MBDEX2.CBL]], Lines 2251-2275)\n\n**3. Specialized Audit Reports**\n- Programs such as LNAURP generate auditors' reports for confidential accounts, supporting both internal and external review processes.\n- These reports can be tailored to specific regulatory or business requirements.\n- Note: LNAURP is noted as \"NOT CURRENTLY USED BY WORLD\" but was designed for this purpose (Source: [[FILE:LNAURP.CBL|LNAURP.CBL]], Lines 1-25).\n\n**4. Review and Oversight Modules**\n- ALLENT and similar programs provide entry, validation, and audit entry routines, supporting the review of transactions and proof checks.\n- Example: ALLENT includes paragraphs like AUDIT-ENTRY and CHECK-PROOF, indicating its use in transaction review and validation (Source: [[FILE:ALLENT|ALLENT]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows).\n\n**5. Error and Exception Logging**\n- Programs such as AUDITW and AUDEXT include error logging and exception handling, ensuring that any irregularities are captured for later investigation.\n- Copybooks like [[FILE:FERRORS.CPY|FERRORS.CPY]] are used for standardized error reporting (Source: [[FILE:AUDEXT.CBL|AUDEXT.CBL]], Index: copybook_usage).\n\n**6. Access Control and Security Review**\n- Integration with security modules (e.g., CHKSEC) allows auditors to verify that access controls are enforced and that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions (Source: [[FILE:CHKSEC|CHKSEC]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs).\n\n**7. Data Integrity and Change Tracking**\n- Audit modules track changes to key data files, providing a historical record of modifications, approvals, and deletions.\n\n**8.

    "question": "What is the typical workflow for processing a customer payment in OTIS?",
    "answer": "The typical workflow for processing a customer payment in OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) involves several coordinated steps across multiple programs and screens, ensuring accurate validation, posting, and audit trail creation. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n---\n\n**1. User Initiates Payment Entry**\n- **Business Purpose:** A customer service representative or payment processor begins the payment process, usually from a payment entry screen (e.g., APIPAY, LONPF9).\n- **Technical Implementation:** The user accesses the payment module via the main menu or a dedicated payment entry screen.\n\n---\n\n**2. Payment Data Entry and Validation**\n- **Business Purpose:** The user enters payment details (amount, account, payment type).\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - The payment entry screen prompts for required fields (amount, account number, payment type).\n  - Validation logic checks:\n    - Amount is within allowed limits (e.g., not negative, not exceeding regulatory caps).\n    - Account status is active and eligible for payment.\n    - Payment type is valid (e.g., regular, refund, partial).\n  - Example: \"Enter the amount to release for payment. For an accrued invoice, the current outstanding amount will be displayed.\"  \n    (Source: [[FILE:AP|AP]]_CDISB_PAYMENT, Index: help_fields)\n\n---\n\n**3. Payment Posting and File Update**\n- **Business Purpose:** The system posts the payment to the customer’s account and updates relevant files.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - The main payment processing program (e.g., APIPAY, LONPF9) performs:\n    - Posting the payment to the account ledger.\n    - Updating payment history and outstanding balance.\n    - Creating output files for batch processing or external reporting (e.g., NCSLP payment output file).\n    - Example: \"Enter 'Y' to create the NCSLP payment output file OR Enter 'N' to skip creating this file.\"  \n      (Source: [[FILE:SP|SP]]_LEXBNK_PAYMENT, Index: help_fields)\n\n---\n\n**4. Audit Trail and Compliance Logging**\n- **Business Purpose:** Ensure all payment transactions are logged for audit and compliance.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - The system creates log entries for each payment transaction.\n  - Audit modules capture user ID, timestamp, transaction details.\n  - Compliance checks may trigger additional reporting or alerts if payment exceeds certain thresholds.\n\n---\n\n**5. Confirmation and Notification**\n- **Business Purpose:** Notify the user and/or customer of successful payment processing.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - The system displays confirmation messages on screen.\n  - May trigger generation of notification letters or emails (e.g., via LONPW9).\n  - Updates status fields and provides reference numbers for tracking.\n\n---\n\n**6. Exception Handling and Error Reporting**\n- **Business Purpose:** Handle invalid entries, failed validations, or system errors.\n- **Technical Implementation:**\n  - Error messages are displayed for invalid data (e.g., \"Amount too large\", \"Invalid account\").\n  - Failed transactions are logged for review.\n  - User may be prompted to correct and re-submit.\n\n---\n\n**Typical Program Flow Example:**\n\n1. **Payment Entry Screen (APIPAY or LONPF9)**\n   - User enters payment details.\n2. **Validation Module**\n   - Checks amount, account status, payment type.\n3. **Payment Posting**\n   - Updates account and payment files.\n   - Optionally creates output files for batch or external processing.\n4. **Audit Logging**\n   - Records transaction for compliance.\n5. **Notification**\n   - Confirms success or reports errors.\n\n---\n\n**Data Flow:**\n- **Input:** Payment details from user.\n- **Processing:** Validation, posting, logging.\n- **Output:** Updated account files, audit logs, confirmation messages, optional batch files.\n\n---\n\n**Key Programs Involved:**\n- **APIPAY:** Main payment processing and validation.\n- **LONPF9:** Batch payment posting and file update.\n- **Audit/Compliance Modules:** Logging and regulatory checks.\n- **Notification Modules (e.g., LONPW9):** Customer communication.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\"

    "question_number": 47,
    "question": "How do users navigate between OTIS screens and modules in daily operations?",
    "answer": "Users navigate between OTIS screens and modules in daily operations using a structured menu-driven interface, supported by programmatic screen transitions and modular program calls. The navigation process is designed to guide users efficiently through various business functions such as loan processing, account inquiry, compliance review, and daily operations.\n\n**Navigation Mechanisms in OTIS:**\n\n**1. Menu-Driven Interface:**\n- Users begin at a main menu screen, which presents options for different modules (e.g., Loan Maintenance, Dealer Maintenance, Addon Maintenance, Batch Processing).\n- Each menu option is linked to a specific COBOL program that handles the corresponding business function.\n- Function keys (e.g., F6, F7) and numbered options allow users to select screens or actions.\n\n**2. Programmatic Screen Transitions:**\n- When a user selects a menu option, the system calls the associated program (e.g., selecting \"Daily Operations\" calls the DAILY program).\n- Each program contains logic to display its own screen, process user input, and, if needed, transition to other screens or modules.\n- Transitions are managed by calling other programs or returning to the menu, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns.\n\n**3. Entry and Exit Points:**\n- Programs typically have entry paragraphs (e.g., FORM-RESET, SETUP-LINK-INFO) that initialize the screen and context.\n- Exit paragraphs (e.g., STOP-RUN) handle returning control to the menu or ending the session.\n\n**4. Modular Program Calls:**\n- Some programs act as intermediaries, both calling other modules and being called themselves (e.g., PERUSE, PSMAIN).\n- This allows users to move between related functions without returning to the main menu each time.\n\n**5. Screen Copybooks and Layouts:**\n- Screen layouts and field definitions are managed via copybooks (e.g., [[FILE:DAILY_SCN.CPY|DAILY_SCN.CPY]], [[FILE:PERUSE_SCN.CPY|PERUSE_SCN.CPY]]), ensuring consistent user experience across modules.\n\n**Example Navigation Flow:**\n1. User logs in and is presented with the main menu (e.g., PGMENU).\n2. User selects \"Daily Operations\" → system calls DAILY program.\n3. DAILY displays its screen, processes input, and may call other programs (e.g., PERUSE for inquiry).\n4. User completes task, exits to menu or transitions to another module via program calls.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n- \"Program DAILY has 117 paragraphs and 0 perform edges; max depth 1 and cycles=absent.

    "question": "What security and access controls govern different user roles in OTIS?",
    "answer": "Security and access controls in OTIS (Online Transaction Information System) are robust and multi-layered, designed to govern different user roles and ensure compliance, data protection, and operational integrity. Here’s how these controls work:\n\n---\n\n**1. User Role-Based Security Profiles**\n\n- Each user in OTIS is assigned a security profile that defines their permitted actions, accessible modules, and data visibility.\n- Profiles are managed and maintained via dedicated programs such as **SECENT** (User Security Profile Maintenance), **SECREA** (Create Security Profiles), and **SECOPY** (Profile Copy/Set Utility).\n- Profiles are stored in files like **SNFILE** and **SEFILE**, which are referenced for authorization checks.\n- According to comments in **[[FILE:SECENT.CBL|SECENT.CBL]]** and **[[FILE:SECREA.CBL|SECREA.CBL]]**, these profiles are created, updated, and audited to ensure only authorized users have access to sensitive functions.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:SECENT.CBL|SECENT.CBL]], [[FILE:SECREA.CBL|SECREA.CBL]], [[FILE:SECOPY.CBL|SECOPY.CBL]], Index: code*\n\n---\n\n**2. Password and Authentication Controls**\n\n- Password management is handled by programs such as **PASSWD** and **PWMAIN** (User Security Password Maintenance).\n- Passwords are stored securely in files defined by copybooks like **[[FILE:GB01PW_SQL.CPY|GB01PW_SQL.CPY]]** (SQL - User Security Password File).\n- Authentication routines verify user credentials before granting access, with logic for password exceptions and forced changes.\n- Password exception maintenance is available as a menu option (see [[FILE:SEMENU_SCN.CPY|SEMENU_SCN.CPY]]: \"10. PASSWORD EXCEPTION MAINTENANCE\").\n  - *Source: [[FILE:PASSWD|PASSWD]], [[FILE:PWMAIN.CBL|PWMAIN.CBL]], [[FILE:GB01PW_SQL.CPY|GB01PW_SQL.CPY]], [[FILE:SEMENU_SCN.CPY|SEMENU_SCN.CPY]], Index: code*\n\n---\n\n**3. Branch and Group Security**\n\n- Access to branch-specific data and reports is governed by branch/group security logic.\n- The **BRSECURE** copybook and related programs check whether a user’s profile allows access to a given branch or group range.\n- Security checks use fields like **BEG-BRANCH** and **END-BRANCH** to enforce range-based access.\n- If a user attempts to access data outside their permitted range, additional password prompts or denial of access are triggered.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:BRSECURE.CPY|BRSECURE.CPY]], BRSECURE, Index: code, flows*\n\n---\n\n**4. Menu and Module Access Restrictions**\n\n- The OTIS menu system (e.g., **SEMENU**) displays options based on the user’s security profile.\n- Certain menu options (such as profile maintenance, audit review, or password exception handling) are only visible or accessible to users with elevated privileges (e.g., administrators, auditors).\n- Screen logic and program calls enforce these restrictions at runtime.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:SEMENU.CBL|SEMENU.CBL]], [[FILE:SEMENU_SCN.CPY|SEMENU_SCN.CPY]], Index: code*\n\n---\n\n**5. Audit Logging and Change Tracking**\n\n- All changes to security profiles, passwords, and access rights are logged for audit purposes.\n- The **AUDITW** program is called to record changes, supporting both internal and external audit requirements.\n- Audit logs include details of who made changes, what was changed, and when.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:SECENT.CBL|SECENT.CBL]] (calls AUDITW), [[FILE:AUDITW.CBL|AUDITW.CBL]], Index: code, copybook_usage*\n\n---\n\n**6. Additional Controls**\n\n- Remote and alternate login detection (see **WHOAMI**) ensures users are properly authenticated whether accessing locally or remotely.\n- Programs like **CHKSEC** and copybooks like **LIBGB/[[FILE:CHKSEC.CPY|CHKSEC.CPY]]** provide additional layers of security validation, including file-level and session-level checks.\n  - *Source: [[FILE:WHOAMI.CBL|WHOAMI.CBL]],

and review, supporting both operational needs and regulatory requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Security profiles and passwords are stored in dedicated files and managed by specialized programs.\n- Branch/group access is checked via copybooks and runtime logic.\n- Menu options and screen transitions are dynamically restricted based on user profile.\n- Audit logging is

    "question": "How do users handle exception cases and escalations in OTIS workflows?",
    "answer": "In OTIS (Online Transaction Information System), users handle exception cases and escalations through a combination of automated program logic, dedicated exception-handling routines, and user-facing screens that guide resolution and escalation steps. The workflow is designed to ensure that exceptions—such as invalid data, account status issues, or transaction errors—are detected, logged, and routed for appropriate action, sometimes requiring user intervention or escalation to higher authority.\n\n**Exception Handling Workflow in OTIS:**\n\n### 1. **Automated Detection of Exceptions**\n- Programs throughout OTIS include logic to check for error conditions and business rule violations.\n- Common checks include:\n  - Invalid account numbers (e.g., `IF IO-FG NOT = 0 MOVE \"INVALID ACCOUNT NUMBER\" TO D-EXCEPTION`)\n  - Voided or paid-off accounts (`IF LN-POCD-NONLOAN MOVE \"ACCOUNT VOIDED\" TO D-EXCEPTION`)\n  - Deceased or fraud status (`IF LN-ACTIONCD = \"DCSD\" MOVE \"ACCOUNT IN DECEASED STATUS\" TO D-EXCEPTION`)\n  - Payment posting errors, duplicate transactions, or missing required fields\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```cobol\n  IF IO-FG NOT = 0\n     MOVE \"INVALID ACCOUNT NUMBER\" TO D-EXCEPTION\n     PERFORM EXCEPT-LINE\n     GO TO NEXT-RECORD.\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:SETIMP.CBL|SETIMP.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n### 2. **Exception Logging and Routing**\n- When an exception is detected, the program typically:\n  - Moves a descriptive message to an exception variable (e.g., `D-EXCEPTION`)\n  - Calls a dedicated exception-handling paragraph or routine (e.g., `PERFORM EXCEPT-LINE`, `PERFORM EXCEPTION-ROUTINE`)\n  - Logs the exception for audit and reporting\n  - Skips further processing for the affected record and moves to the next\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```cobol\n  PERFORM EXCEPTION-ROUTINE\n  GO TO BULK-TRANSFER-NEXT\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:BULKT2.CBL|BULKT2.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n### 3. **User Notification and Escalation**\n- For exceptions that require user attention, the system:\n  - Displays error messages or exception details on the screen\n  - May prompt the user to correct the issue, provide additional information, or escalate to a supervisor\n  - Some exceptions are routed to specialized screens or modules for resolution (e.g., exception queues, supervisor review screens)\n\n### 4. **Escalation Paths**\n- If an exception cannot be resolved at the current user level, escalation logic is triggered:\n  - The record may be flagged for supervisor review or sent to an exception queue\n  - Certain exception codes (e.g., fraud, deceased, large payment errors) automatically trigger escalation\n  - Escalation routines may involve additional programs or modules dedicated to exception management\n\n### 5. **Exception Totals and Reporting**\n- Programs like LONPW9 and LONPWA aggregate exception counts and generate summary reports for management review.\n- Exception totals are printed and tracked for audit purposes.\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```cobol\n  IF TOTAL-EXCEPTION(LEV) NOT = 0\n     IF LEV = 1\n        MOVE \"TOTAL EXCEPTIONS BR# &&&&\" TO S-BRNAME\n        INSPECT S-BRNAME REPLACING FIRST \"&&&&\" BY BR-NO\n  ```\n  (Source: [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n---\n\n### **Key Programs and Routines Involved**\n- **SETIMP**: Handles account status exceptions (invalid, voided, paid-off, deceased, fraud).\n- **BULKT2, BULKG2, CLAST2**: Bulk processing modules with exception routines for transfer errors.\n- **LONPW9, LONPWA**: Loan payment modules with detailed exception handling and reporting.\n- **EXCEPTION-ROUTINE, EXCEPT-LINE, MAIN-EXCEPTION**: Standard paragraphs for logging and processing exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Representation: Exception Handling Flow in OTIS**\n\nHere's a visual representation:\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Exception Handling Workflow</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 1: Automated Detection -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"160\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Automated Detection</text>\n  <text x=\"160\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"white\">Business Rule Checks</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 2: Logging & Routing -->\n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#ef4444\" stroke=\"#dc2626\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Exception Logging & Routing</text>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"white\">Log, Skip, Route</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 3: User Notification -->\n  <rect x=\"590\" y=\"80\" width=\"220\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#667eea\" stroke=\"#4338ca\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">User Notification</text>\n  <text x=\"700\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"white\">Screen Display, Prompt</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 4: Escalation -->\n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"200\" width=\"220\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#4ade80\" stroke=\"#16a34a\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"230\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Escalation</text>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"250\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"white\">Supervisor Review, Queue</text>\n  \n  <!-- Step 5: Reporting -->\n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"320\" width=\"220\" height=\"70\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"350\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Exception Reporting</text>\n  <text x=\"430\" y=\"370\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#15803d\">Totals, Audit, Management</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"270\" y1=\"115\" x2=\"320\" y2=\"115\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"540\" y1=\"115\" x2=\"590\" y2=\"115\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"700\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"430\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"430\" y1=\"270\" x2=\"430\" y2=\"320\" stroke=\"#333\" stroke-width=\"3\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- Exception handling in OTIS is systematic and multi-layered.\n- Automated program logic detects and logs exceptions.\n- Users are notified and prompted for action when needed.\n- Escalation paths ensure unresolved exceptions are reviewed by supervisors or routed to exception queues.\n- Exception totals are reported for audit and management oversight.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [[FILE:SETIMP.CBL|SETIMP.CBL]], [[FILE:BULKT2.CBL|BULKT2.CBL]], [[FILE:LONPW9.CBL|LONPW9.CBL]], [[FILE:LONPWA.CBL|LONPWA.CBL]] (Index: code, flows)\n- Exception routines and reporting logic (Index: code, flow_edges)",

    "question": "What training and support materials exist for OTIS users across different roles?",
    "answer": "Training and support materials for OTIS users across different roles are provided through a combination of in-system help modules, dedicated support programs, and documentation embedded within the application. Here’s a summary of what exists based on the retrieved context:\n\n### 1. In-System Help Modules\n\n- **HELP Program:**  \n  The HELP program is a dedicated module within OTIS that provides interactive help to users. It contains 47 paragraphs focused on displaying help windows, processing help elements, and guiding users through system functions.\n  - Entry paragraphs include: CALL-HELP, HELP-PROCESS-ELEMENTS, HELP-DISPLAY-WINDOW.\n  - Designed for immediate, context-sensitive assistance for users at all levels.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:HELP|HELP]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n\n### 2. Embedded Documentation and Comments\n\n- **Program-Level Comments:**  \n  Many COBOL programs in OTIS include detailed comments in their IDENTIFICATION DIVISION and throughout the code. These comments explain business logic, user actions, and special cases, serving as reference material for both users and support staff.\n  - Example: WHOAMI program includes a description of its purpose and usage scenario for login validation.\n  - Example: BNKLGL program documents business rules for repossession/legal reporting.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:WHOAMI.CBL|WHOAMI.CBL]], [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n- **Copybook Documentation:**  \n  Copybooks such as [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]] and [[FILE:RBACT.CPY|RBACT.CPY]] include dummy sections and comments specifically for support and training purposes. These sections are meant to be reflected in \"WHAT\" commands for support, making them accessible to users and support personnel for troubleshooting and understanding system behavior.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]], [[FILE:RBACT.CPY|RBACT.CPY]], Index: code)\n\n### 3. Support Programs\n\n- **SUPPORT Program:**  \n  The SUPPORT program is present in the system and is called by other modules when users require assistance. While it does not make outgoing calls, it acts as a central point for support-related functions.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:SUPPORT|SUPPORT]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs)\n\n### 4. Role-Specific Guidance\n\n- **Role-Based Help Content:**  \n  The HELP module and embedded documentation are designed to address the needs of different user roles, including:\n    - Front-line users (e.g., customer service, loan processors)\n    - Supervisors and managers (e.g., exception handling, escalations)\n    - Technical support staff (e.g., troubleshooting, system maintenance)\n  - Comments and help routines often specify which user actions are permitted for each role, and provide guidance on handling exceptions and escalations.\n\n### 5. Exception Handling and Escalation Support\n\n- **Exception Documentation:**  \n  Programs such as [[FILE:INBRTR.CBL|INBRTR.CBL]] and [[FILE:LNCRE2.CBL|LNCRE2.CBL]] include comments and logic for handling exception cases, with clear documentation on what users should do when encountering errors or unusual situations.\n  - Example: [[FILE:INBRTR.CBL|INBRTR.CBL]] provides messages and prompts for posting restrictions and error handling.\n  - Example: [[FILE:LNCRE2.CBL|LNCRE2.CBL]] documents folder requirements and exception cases that halt processing.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:INBRTR.CBL|INBRTR.CBL]], [[FILE:LNCRE2.CBL|LNCRE2.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n### 6. Training via Program Flow and Business Rules\n\n- **Business Rule Comments:**  \n  Many programs include business rule explanations, which serve as training material for users to understand why certain actions are required or restricted.\n  - Example: [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]] explains the prioritization of bankruptcy and legal statuses.\n  - (Source: [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]], Index: code)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Key Training and Support Materials:**\n\n| Material Type            | Example/Source           | Purpose/Role                                    |\n|------------------------- |-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| In-System Help Module    | HELP (flows)            | Interactive, context-sensitive user assistance   |\n| Program-Level Comments   | [[FILE:WHOAMI.CBL|WHOAMI.CBL]], [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]]  | Business logic, user actions, scenario guidance  |\n| Copybook Documentation   | [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]], [[FILE:RBACT.CPY|RBACT.CPY]] | Support/training sections for troubleshooting    |\n| Support Program          | SUPPORT (programs)       | Centralized support functions                   |\n| Exception Documentation  | [[FILE:INBRTR.CBL|INBRTR.CBL]], [[FILE:LNCRE2.CBL|LNCRE2.CBL]]  | Guidance for error handling and escalation       |\n| Business Rule Comments   | [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]]              | Training on business process requirements        |\n\n---\n\n**Business Interpretation:**  \nOTIS provides comprehensive training and support materials embedded directly in the application, ensuring users across all roles have access to guidance, troubleshooting, and business rule explanations. This approach supports efficient onboarding, ongoing learning, and effective resolution of operational issues.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**  \n- Interactive help via the HELP program\n- Embedded comments and documentation in COBOL source and copybooks\n- Centralized support routines\n- Role-specific guidance and exception handling documentation\n\n**Sources:**\n- HELP (Source: [[FILE:HELP|HELP]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: flows)\n- SUPPORT (Source: [[FILE:SUPPORT|SUPPORT]], [[FILE:I|I]]ndex: programs)\n- [[FILE:WHOAMI.CBL|WHOAMI.CBL]], [[FILE:BNKLGL.CBL|BNKLGL.CBL]], [[FILE:INBRTR.CBL|INBRTR.CBL]], [[FILE:LNCRE2.CBL|LNCRE2.CBL]], [[FILE:LPEOD5TR.CPY|LPEOD5TR.CPY]], [[FILE:RBACT.CPY|RBACT.CPY]] (Source: respective filenames, Index: code)\n\n---\n\n**Here's a visual representation of how support and training materials are integrated in OTIS:**\n\n<svg width=\"900\" height=\"400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"22\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1a1a1a\">OTIS Training & Support Architecture</text>\n  \n  <!-- Help Module -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#e0e7ff\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#4338ca\">HELP Program</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#6366f1\">Interactive User Assistance</text>\n  \n  <!-- Support Program -->\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dbeafe\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#1e40af\">SUPPORT Program</text>\n  <text x=\"450\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#3b82f6\">Centralized Support Functions</text>\n  \n  <!-- Embedded Documentation -->\n  <rect x=\"650\" y=\"80\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#dcfce7\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"3\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"750\" y=\"110\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#15803d\">Embedded Documentation</text>\n  <text x=\"750\" y=\"130\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#22c55e\">Program & Copybook Comments</text>\n  \n  <!-- User Roles -->\n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"250\" width=\"120\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"260\" y=\"280\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Front-Line Users</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"400\" y=\"250\" width=\"120\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"460\" y=\"280\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Supervisors</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"600\" y=\"250\" width=\"120\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#f59e0b\" stroke=\"#d97706\" stroke-width=\"2\" rx=\"8\"/>\n  <text x=\"660\" y=\"280\" text-anchor=\"middle\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"white\">Support Staff</text>\n  \n  <!-- Arrows from modules to user roles -->\n  <defs>\n    <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"10\" markerHeight=\"10\" refX=\"9\" refY=\"3\" orient=\"auto\">\n      <polygon points=\"0 0, 10 3, 0 6\" fill=\"#333\"/>\n    </marker>\n  </defs>\n  <line x1=\"150\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"260\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#667eea\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"450\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"460\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#3b82f6\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"750\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"660\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#22c55e\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\"/>\n</svg>",
